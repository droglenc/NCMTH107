<h2>Differences Between Z and Z<sup>*</sup></h2>
<p>When applying the <a href="../11-steps">11-steps of any Hypothesis Test</a> to a 1-Sample Z-test, you will compute a Z test statistic in Step 6 and Z<span class="math inline">\(^{*}\)</span> “critical value” when constructing a confidence region in Step 11. These two values both come from the standard normal (i.e., Z) distribution, but they are <strong>NOT THE SAME</strong> and, thus, it is important to understand how they differ.</p>
<p>The Z test statistic is computed with <span class="math inline">\(Z=\frac{\bar{x}-\mu_{0}}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}\)</span> and is a measure of how many standard errors (i.e., <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\)</span>) the sample mean (<span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span>) is from the hypothesized population mean (<span class="math inline">\(\mu_{0}\)</span>). As [shown here] its actual calculation depends on what “more extreme” means from H<sub>A</sub>. It is ultimately used to compute the p-value so that (with α) you can make a decision about H<sub>0</sub>.</p>
<p>Z<span class="math inline">\(^{*}\)</span> is a critical value that determines how many standard errors wide a confidence regions should be so that it will contain the parameter (e.g., <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>) the confidence level (e.g., 90, 95, or 99%) of times. As <a href="Calc_CI_Z">shown here</a> Z<span class="math inline">\(^{*}\)</span> depends on the level of confidence and what “more extreme” means from H<sub>A</sub>.</p>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
<strong>Note:</strong>
<ul>
<li>
The Z test statistic is always computed from <span class="math inline">\(Z=\frac{\bar{x}-\mu_{0}}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}\)</span>. It will be used in a FORWARD calculation to find the p-value (i.e., the area “more extreme” of Z).
<li>
Z<span class="math inline">\(^{*}\)</span> is always computed from a REVERSE calculation (i.e., the Z with the level of confidence “more extreme”).

<h2>First Example</h2>
<p>Suppose that I hypothesized that the mean time to take a quiz is less than 100 minutes and that, in a sample of 30 students, the mean time to take the quiz was 95.2 minutes. Further, suppose that σ=20 and α=0.10. For simplicity below, note that the SE is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{20}{\sqrt{30}}\)</span>=3.651 and the level of confidence is 100(1-0.10)=90%.</p>
<p>In this case, the Z test statistic is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{95.2-100}{3.651}\)</span>=-1.315. This means that the sample mean (95.2) is 1.3 standard errors less than the hypothesized mean (100). Ultimately this results in a p-value of 0.0943 as computed with</p>
<pre class="r"><code>&gt; distrib(-1.315) # recall mean=0, sd=1, and lower.tail=TRUE are defaults</code></pre>
<p><img src="Diff_Z_and_Zstar_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="336" /></p>
<p>which is the same (within rounding) as what would be computed with the more familiar</p>
<pre class="r"><code>&gt; distrib(95.2,mean=100,sd=20/sqrt(30))</code></pre>
<p><img src="Diff_Z_and_Zstar_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="336" /></p>
<p>This p-value is less than α so we would NOT reject H<sub>0</sub> and conclude that it does not take significantly less than a mean of 100 minutes for ALL students to take the quiz.</p>
<p>In this case we will constuct a 90% upper confidence bound for μ. Thus, Z<span class="math inline">\(^{*}\)</span> is the Z that has 90% UPPER (i.e., the direction of H<sub>A</sub>) and is 1.282 as computed with</p>
<pre class="r"><code>&gt; distrib(0.90,type=&quot;q&quot;) # recall mean=0, sd=1, and lower.tail=TRUE are defaults</code></pre>
<p><img src="Diff_Z_and_Zstar_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="336" /></p>
<p>The upper confidence bound value is thus 95.2+1.282<span class="math inline">\(\frac{20}{\sqrt{30}}\)</span> = 95.2+4.7=99.9. Thus, I am 90% confident that the mean time for all students to take the quiz is less than 99.9 minutes.</p>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p>In this example, note how the Z test statistic (-1.315) is not related at all to Z<span class="math inline">\(^{*}\)</span> except that they both are from a Z distribution (mean=0, sd=1) and the shaded area was in the same direction (because both use H<sub>A</sub>. Make note of this in the next two examples as well.</p>

<h2>Second Example</h2>
<p>Suppose that I hypothesized that the mean time to walk between the Science Center and the Ponzio Center is more than 7 minutes and that, in a sample of 50 students, the mean time to make this walk was 8.3 minutes. Further, suppose that σ=1.3 and α=0.05 so that SE=<span class="math inline">\(\frac{1.3}{\sqrt{50}}\)</span>=0.184 and the level of confidence is 95%.</p>
<p>The Z test statistic is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{8.3-7}{0.184}\)</span>=7.065 which results in a p-value of 0.0000000000008031 and a clear rejection of H<sub>0</sub>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>&gt; distrib(7.065,lower.tail=FALSE)</code></pre>
<p><img src="Diff_Z_and_Zstar_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="336" /></p>
<p>The 95% lower confidence bound uses Z<span class="math inline">\(^{*}\)</span>=-1.282 as found with</p>
<pre class="r"><code>&gt; distrib(0.95,type=&quot;q&quot;,lower.tail=FALSE)</code></pre>
<p><img src="Diff_Z_and_Zstar_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="336" /></p>
<p>The lower confidence bound value is thus 8.3-1.645<span class="math inline">\(\frac{1.3}{\sqrt{50}}\)</span> = 8.3-0.30=8.00 and I am 90% confident that the mean time for all students to walk between the Science Center and the Ponzio Center is more than 8.00 minutes.</p>

<div id="third-example" class="section level2">
<h2>Third Example</h2>
<p>Suppose that I hypothesized that the mean time students spend preparing for the prep check is different than 30 minutes and that, in a sample of 40 students, the mean preparation time was 33.8 minutes. Further, suppose that σ=9.7 and α=0.01 so that SE=<span class="math inline">\(\frac{9.7}{\sqrt{40}}\)</span>=1.534 and the level of confidence is 99%.</p>
<p>The Z test statistic is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{33.8-30}{1.534}\)</span>=2.477 which results in a half p-value of 0.0066 and a whole p-value of 0.0132 which results in NOT rejecting H<sub>0</sub>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>&gt; distrib(2.477,lower.tail=FALSE)</code></pre>
<p><img src="Diff_Z_and_Zstar_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="336" /></p>
<p>The 99% confidence interval uses Z<span class="math inline">\(^{*}\)</span>=±2.576 as shown below.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>&gt; distrib(0.005,type=&quot;q&quot;,lower.tail=FALSE)</code></pre>
<p><img src="Diff_Z_and_Zstar_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="336" /></p>
<p>The confidence interval is 33.8±2.576<span class="math inline">\(\frac{9.7}{\sqrt{40}}\)</span> = 33.8±3.95=(29.85,37.75). Thus, I am 99% confident that the mean time that all students spend preparing for the prep checks is between 29.85 and 37.75 minutes.</p>
