<h2>Steps to Follow</h2>
<p>Constructing and interpreting a p-value is made easier with these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Identify H<sub>0</sub> and H<sub>A</sub></strong></li>
<li><strong>Define the p-value specific to the situation.</strong>
<ul>
<li>In the generic p-value definition (“probability of the observed statistic or a value more extreme assuming the H<sub>0</sub> is true) replace”observed statistic" with the value of <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span>, “more extreme” with “less”, “greater”, or “different” depending on H<sub>A</sub>, and “the H<sub>0</sub> is true” with the specific value of μ in H<sub>0</sub>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Draw the null distribution.</strong>
<ul>
<li>This is the sampling distribution assuming that H<sub>0</sub> is true. Thus, it will be centered on the μ in H<sub>0</sub> and will use a standard error of <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\)</span>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Compute the p-value.</strong>
<ul>
<li>This will be a FORWARD calculation on a normal distribution centered on μ from H<sub>0</sub> with an area shaded “more extreme” (depending on H<sub>A</sub>) of <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span>.</li>
<li>If H<sub>A</sub> is a “not equals” then “more extreme” means into the nearest tail and then multiplied by 2.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Make a decision about H<sub>0</sub>.</strong> <em>If the question has a context then the parameter should be stated within the context of the question.</em>
<ul>
<li>If the p-value&lt;α then reject H<sub>0</sub> (in favor of H<sub>A</sub>.</li>
<li>If the p-value&gt;α then do not reject (DNR) H<sub>0</sub> (in favor of H<sub>A</sub>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h2>First Example</h2>
<p>Suppose that I hypothesized that the mean time to take a quiz is less than 100 minutes and that, in a sample of 30 students, the mean time to take the quiz was 95.2 minutes. Further, suppose that σ=20 and α=0.10.</p>
<ol>
<li>H<sub>0</sub>: μ=100 versus H<sub>A</sub>: μ&lt;100, where μ is the mean time to take a quiz.</li>
<li>The p-value is the “probability that <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span>=95.2 or less assuming that μ=100.”</li>
<li>The null distribution will have a mean of 100 and a SE of <span class="math inline">\(\frac{20}{\sqrt{30}}\)</span>=3.651. See drawing below.</li>
<li>The p-value is 0.0943 as computed below.</li>
<li>Reject H<sub>0</sub> because p-value&lt;α (i.e., 0.0943&lt;0.10). Thus, it appears that the mean time for ALL students to take the quiz is less than 100 minutes.</li>

<div id="second-example" class="section level2">
<h2>Second Example</h2>
<p>Suppose that I hypothesized that the mean time to walk between the Science Center and the Ponzio Center is more than 7 minutes and that, in a sample of 50 students, the mean time to make this walk was 8.3 minutes. Further, suppose that σ=1.3 and α=0.05.</p>
<ol>
<li>H<sub>0</sub>: μ=7 versus H<sub>A</sub>: μ&gt;7, where μ is the mean time to walk between the Science Center and the Ponzio Center.</li>
<li>The p-value is the “probability that <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span>=8.3 or greater assuming that μ=7.”</li>
<li>The null distribution will have a mean of 7 and a SE of <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1.3}{\sqrt{50}}\)</span>=0.184. See drawing below.</li>
<li>The p-value is 0.0000000000007687 as computed below. Note that the p-value does not need all of these decimals and, thus, I will usually show this as &lt;0.00005.</li>
<li>Reject H<sub>0</sub> because p-value&lt;α (i.e., &lt;0.00005&lt;0.05). Thus, it appears that the mean time for ALL students to walk between the Science Center and the Ponzio Center is greater than 7 minutes.</li>

<h2>Third Example</h2>
<p>Suppose that I hypothesized that the mean time students spend preparing for the prep check is different than 30 minutes and that, in a sample of 40 students, the mean preparation time was 33.8 minutes. Further, suppose that σ=9.7 and α=0.01.</p>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
When H<sub>A</sub> is a “not equals” then the area shaded on the null distribution is into the nearest tail. In this case, because <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> (=33.8) was greater than the mean of the distribution (=30), I shaded to the right (into the nearer “upper tail”). If the <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> had been lower, I would have shaded to the left. In these situations (i.e., when H<sub>A</sub> is a “not equals”) then the area returned by <code>distrib()</code> must be multiplied by two to get the p-value (to account for both tails of the same size).
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<ol>
<li>H<sub>0</sub>: μ=30 versus H<sub>A</sub>: μ≠30, where μ is the mean time preparing for the prep check.</li>
<li>The p-value is the “probability that <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span>=33.8 or no assuming that μ=30.”</li>
<li>The null distribution will have a mean of 30 and a SE of <span class="math inline">\(\frac{9.7}{\sqrt{40}}\)</span>=1.534. See drawing below.</li>
<li>The half p-value is 0.0066 as computed below. Thus, the p-value is 0.0132</li>
<li>Do not reject H<sub>0</sub> because p-value&gt;α (i.e., 0.0132&gt;0.01). Thus, it appears that the mean time that ALL students spend preparing for the prep check is not different than 30 minutes.</li>
