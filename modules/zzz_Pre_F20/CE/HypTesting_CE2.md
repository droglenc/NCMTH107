## P-Value Calculations and Decisions II

For each situation below, (i) write a sentence that defines the p-value specific to that situation (i.e., replace the generic terms in the definition of the p-value with specifics for the particular situation), (ii) compute the p-value (include a drawing to support your calculation), and (iii) make a decision about H<sub>0</sub> (i.e., reject or do not reject H<sub>0</sub> and explain why).

1. H<sub>A</sub>: &mu;>880, &sigma;=90, n=80, x&#772;=918, &alpha;=0.01.
1. H<sub>A</sub>: &mu;&#8800;800, &sigma;=60, n=25, x&#772;=824, &alpha;=0.01.
1. &alpha;=0.05, H<sub>A</sub>: &mu;<80, n=30, &sigma;=20, x&#772;=73.
1. &alpha;=0.05, H<sub>A</sub>: &mu;&#8800;1500, n=40, &sigma;=800, x&#772;=1370.
