<h2>Equation of the Line II</h2>
<p>For each situation below, identify the (a) response variable, (b) explanatory variable, (c) slope, and (d) intercept; interpret the (e) slope and (f) intercept; (g) construct a valid prediction (and answer the question you construct); and (h) identify what an extrapolation would be.</p>

<li><a href="http://www.publish.csiro.au/?paper=ZO9800607">Poole and Carpenter (1980)</a> used nasal length (<em>mm multiplied by 10</em>) to predict nasal width (<em>mm multiplied by 10</em>) of Grey Kangaroos (<em>Macropus fuliginosus</em>). The resulting best fit line was Y=0.2876*X+46.451 for 450&lt;X&lt;900 and 180&lt;Y&lt;320.</li>

<h2>Estimating Fishing Pressure</h2>
<p><img src="zimgs/boat-launch.jpg" alt="Fishing Pressure" class="img-right"></p>
<p>Wyoming Fish and Game researchers would like to be able to predict monthly fishing pressure (total number of angler-hours) with an index count of the number of vehicles in lake access parking lots because the latter is much cheaper to measure than the former. Towards this end they examined the relationship between pressure and index count on weekdays of Alcova Reservoir. Use the data in AlcovaRes.csv (<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/AlcovaRes.csv">data</a>, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/AlcovaRes_meta.txt">meta</a>), <strong>properly filtered to include only the data from the weekdays</strong>, to construct results that can be used to answer the questions below.</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the response variable?</li>
<li>What is the explanatory variable?</li>
<li>In terms of the variables of this problem, what is the equation of the best-fit line?</li>
<li>In terms of the variables of this problem, interpret the value of the slope.</li>
<li>In terms of the variables of this problem, interpret the value of the intercept.</li>
<li>What is the predicted pressure for an index count of 20 vehicles?</li>
<li>What is the predicted pressure for an index count of 5 vehicles?</li>
<li>What is the residual if the pressure is 5100 and the index count is 8 vehicles?</li>
<li>What is the correlation coefficient between pressure and index count?</li>
<li>What proportion of the variability in pressure is explained by knowing the index count?</li>
<li>How much will the pressure estimate be under-predicted, on average, if the number of vehicles is accidentally under-counted by two vehicles?</li>
<li>What aspect of this regression analysis concerns you (i.e., consider the regression assumptions)?</li>

<h2>Cafe Sales</h2>
<p><img src="zimgs/cafe.jpg" alt="Cafe" class="img-right"> <a href="http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n1/depaolo.pdf">DePaolo and Robinson (2011)</a> reported on data collected from a cafe run by business students at Indiana State University. The cafe was begun because a commercial vendor had closed a similar business. The group of business students opened a replacement business and carefully monitored sales and costs over a ten-week period during the spring semester of 2010. The students recorded extensive data in CafeData.csv (<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/CafeData.csv">data</a>, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/CafeData_meta.txt">meta</a>). Load these data into R and answer the questions below related to determining how coffee sales are impacted by maximum daily temperature. [<em>Note that these are the same data that you may have entered in a <a href="UEDAQuant2_CE2.html#cafe-sales">this</a> or <a href="BEDAQuant_CE2.html#cafe-sales">this</a> previous class exercise.</em>]</p>
<ol>
<li>In terms of the variables of this problem, what is the equation of the best-fit line?</li>
<li>In terms of the variables of this problem, INTERPRET the value of the slope?</li>
<li>In terms of the variables of this problem, INTERPRET the value of the y-intercept?</li>
<li>What is the predicted coffee sales when the maximum temperature is 40?</li>
<li>What is the predicted coffee sales when the maximum temperature is 90?</li>
<li>What is the residual if coffee sales were 30 and the maxmum temperature was 40?</li>
<li>What is the correlation coefficient between coffee sales and maximum temperature?</li>
<li>What proportion of the variability in coffee sales is explained by knowing the maximum temperature?</li>
<li>What aspect of this regression analysis concerns you (i.e., consider the regression assumptions)?</li>
