## Math Class Grades
<img src="zimgs/math_exam.jpg" alt="Math Grades" class="img-right">

The University of North Carolina math department is noted for "giving out" low grades. To examine this, the GPA from a random sample of 22 math classes and 29 "other" university classes (from the last year) was collected and recorded in [UNCGrades.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/UNCgrades.csv). Use these data to answer the following questions.

1. Separately, perform an appropriate EDA for each type of class. Refer to figures and tables as appropriate. [*HINT: You may construct a figure for each type of class with just one R command. One command may also be used to construct a table that contains results for each class type.*]
1. What two MAJOR conclusions might you make about differences in GPA between the two class types based on your observations above. [*HINT: Focus on EDA characteristics that you described in your answer to the previous question.*]

## Effluent Sampling Labs

Municipal wastewater treatment plants are required by law to monitor their discharges into rivers and streams on a regular basis. Concern about the reliability of data from one of these self-monitoring programs led to a study in which samples of effluent were divided and sent to two labs -- a State of Wisconsin lab and a private commercial lab. Each lab measured the Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) on the effluent sample sent to them. Enter these data (in stacked format with two columns labeled `lab` and `bod`) into a CSV file and read into an object named `df` in R.

<pre>
State -- 6,6,8,11,18,20,28,33,34,43,71
Private -- 15,25,28,29,34,35,36,39,42,44,54
</pre>

1. Perform separate appropriate EDAs for each lab. Refer to figures and tables as appropriate. [*HINT: You may construct a figure for each lab with just one R command. One command may also be used to construct a table that contains results for each lab.*]
1. Comment on two MAJOR differences in the results from the two labs?

## Cafe Sales
<img src="zimgs/cafe.jpg" alt="Cafe" class="img-right">
[DePaolo and Robinson (2011)](http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n1/depaolo.pdf) reported on data collected from a cafe run by business students at Indiana State University. The cafe was begun because a commercial vendor had closed a similar business. The group of business students opened a replacement business and carefully monitored sales and costs over a ten-week period during the spring semester of 2010. The students recorded extensive data in CafeData.csv ([data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/CafeData.csv), [meta](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/CafeData_meta.txt)). Load these data into R, **refactor** the day of the week variable to be in proper order (see [this FAQ](../../resources/FAQ/FAQs/reorder-levels.html)), and answer the questions below.

1. Perform a univariate EDA for the number of coffees sold.
1. Examine the effect of day of the week on the distribution of number of coffees sold.
1. Perform a univariate EDA for the number of sodas sold.
1. Examine the effect of day of the week on the distribution of number of sodas sold.
1. Construct a "take home message" from your analyses.
