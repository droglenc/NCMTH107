## Credit Card Limits
<img src="zimgs/credit-card.jpg" alt="Credit Cards" class="img-right">

Credit card companies use a regression model (includes such factors as income, employment, credit history) to determine the credit worthiness of a prospective card holder. In the past, the companies used a threshold (cutoff) limit of 630 to receive a card. It is also assumed that the standard deviation of all potential credit card holders is 5. Recent information suggests that delinquencies have been increasing and it is hypothesized that credit card companies will raise the "cutoff score" in response. Examine the following results concerning "cutoff scores" from 44 credit card issuers to determine, at the 10% level, if there is evidence that the "cutoff score" has been increased significantly from 630.

<pre>
Variable   Mean  Median StDev  Min  Max    Q1     Q3
CCards   636.86  636.50  4.42  629  647  633.25 640.00

## Raptors at Hawk Ridge
<img src="zimgs/hawk_ridge.jpg" alt="Hawk Ridge" class="img-right">
The Duluth, MN Tourism Board would like to advertise that, on average, more than 50,000 raptors are seen at [Hawk Ridge](http://www.hawkridge.org/) per year.  The numbers of various raptor species was observed from 1971-2003 and recorded in HawksRidge.csv ([file](https://github.com/droglenc/NCData/raw/master/HawksRidge.csv), [meta](https://github.com/droglenc/NCData/blob/master/HawksRidge_meta.txt)).  Note that the `Total` variable should be used here as the Board is focused on the total number of raptors seen in a year.  Further, assume that it is known that the population standard deviation is 37,000 raptors per year.  The board wants there to be strong, if any, evidence to support their claim (i.e., test at the 1% level).  Determine if these data support the Board's claim.  Make sure to provide explicit answers with your work shown for all [11 steps of a hypothesis test](../11-steps).
