## Wood-Burning Example
<img src="zimgs/woodstove.jpg" alt="Wood Stove" class="img-right">
Suppose that the amount of wood that I burn per day is approximately normally distributed with a mean of 16 ft$^3$ and a standard deviation of 4 ft$^3$.  Use this information to answer the questions below.

* What is an individual?
* What is the variable and what type of variable is it?
* On what proportion of days do I burn less than 22 ft$^3$ of wood?
* On what proportion of days do I burn more than 15 ft$^3$ of wood?
* On what proportion of days do I burn between 11 and 26 ft$^3$ of wood?
* What is the amount of wood burned per day such that I burn less than that amount on 10% of the days?
* What is the amount of wood burned per day such that I burn more than that amount on 20% of the days?
* What are the most common 50% of amounts of wood burned per day?
