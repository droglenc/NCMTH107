## Goodness-of-Fit Test
[Four-o'clocks (*Mirabilis jalapa*)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirabilis_jalapa) are plants native to tropical America.  Individual four-o'clocks can have red, white, or pink flowers.  Flower color in this species is thought to be controlled by a single gene locus with two alleles experssing incomplete dominance, so that heterozygotes are pink-flowered, while homozygotes for one allele are white-flowered and homozygotes for the other allele are red-flowered [(see this)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirabilis_jalapa#Genetic_studies).  According to [Mendelian genetic principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendelian_inheritance), self-pollination of pink-flowered plants should produce progeny that have red, pink, and white flowers in a 1:2:1 ratio.  A horticulturist allowed several pink-flowered plants to self-pollinate and produce 240 progeny with 55 that were red-flowered, 132 that were pink-flowered, and 53 that were white-flowered.  Use the results to determine, at the 5% level, if the theoretical 1:2:1 ratio is upheld with these data.

```{r par1a=TRUE, fig.show='asis', warning=FALSE}
obs <- c(red=55,pink=132,white=53)
exp.p <- c(red=1/4,pink=2/4,white=1/4)
chi1 <- chisq.test(obs,p=exp.p,rescale.p=TRUE,correct=FALSE)
chi1$expected
chi1$observed
chi1
gofCI(chi1,digits=3)
```
