## Background
[Erickson et al. (2004)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1017/S0952836903004400/abstract) compared the bite-force performance between [American Alligators (*Alligator mississippiensis*)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_alligator) from the wild and those that had been in long-term captivity.  In one aspect of their research they examined the relationship between the `mass` (kg) and snout-vent length (`svl`; cm) of the alligators.  Their primary interest here was in determining if variability in the mass could be explained by knowing the snout-vent length of the individual.  The data are recorded in [Alligators1.csv](https://github.com/droglenc/NCData/blob/master/Alligators1.csv).  Use these data to describe the relationship between the mass and snout-vent length of the alligators.

## Getting The Data
```{r echo=FALSE}
d <- read.csv("https://github.com/droglenc/NCData/raw/master/Alligators1.csv")
```
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(NCStats)
```
```{r eval=FALSE}
setwd("C:/stats/")
d <- read.csv("Alligators1.csv")
```
```{r}
str(d)
headtail(d)
```

## Bivariate EDA -- Quantitative
```{r fig.show='asis', par1=TRUE}
plot(mass~svl,data=d,xlab="Snout-Vent Length (cm)",ylab="Body Mass (KG)",pch=19)
corr(mass~svl,data=d)
corr(mass~svl,data=d,use="pairwise.complete.obs")
plot(mass~svl,data=d,xlab="Snout-Vent Length (cm)",ylab="Body Mass (KG)",pch=19,col=type)
legend("topleft",levels(d$type),pch=19,col=1:2,bty="n")
```
