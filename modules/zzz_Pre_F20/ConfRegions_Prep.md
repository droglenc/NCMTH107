Use the preparation readings and videos to prepare WRITTEN answers (to bring to class) for the following questions. Please contact <a href="mailto:dogle@northland.edu">Dr. Ogle</a> if you have questions.

1. What do we hope is contained within the bounds of a confidence interval?
1. How many 95% confidence regions contain the parameter of interest? 90%? 99%?
1. How often will you make an incorrect conclusion about the value of the parameter if you use a 95% confidence region? 90%? 99%?
1. How is the level of confidence (C) determined from &alpha;?
1. How is the alternative hypothesis used to decide whether to construct a confidence interval, lower confidence bound, or upper confidence bound?
1. What are the five steps in computing a proper confidence region?
1. If the value in the null hypothesis is contained within a confidence region, will that null hypothesis be rejected or not rejected?
1. What does the relative width of a confidence interval tell us about how the parameter is estimated? [*i.e., how does a narrow confidence interval compare to a wide one in terms of estimating the parameter.*]
1. What decisions can a statistician make that will result in a narrower confidence interval? Which decision is "better"?
1. What is the formula for computing a desired sample size? What do you need to know or be able to define to use this formula?
1. What R code do you use to find the scaling factor used to construct a confidence region?
1. Find Z<sup>*</sup> (to three decimals) for each situation in the table below.

|  C  |   Interval   | Lower Bound | Upper Bound |
|:---:|:------------:|:-----------:|-------------|
| 90% |              |             |             |
| 95% |              |             |             |
| 99% |              |             |             |
