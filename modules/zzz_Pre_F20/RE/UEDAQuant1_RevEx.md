## Number of States Visited
<img src="zimgs/travel.jpg" alt="Traveling" class="img-right">

A student asked six of her friends how many states they had visited in their lifetime. Their answers 8, 3, 17, 15, 4, and 19. Compute the median, mean, standard deviation, and range of these data "by hand."

## Home Range of Red Kangaroos
<img src="zimgs/red_kangaroo.jpg" alt="Red Kangaroo" class="img-right">

In a preliminary study, a researcher recorded the weekly home range of five Red Kangaroos (*Macropus rufus*) in New South Wales. The five home ranges were 258, 310, 560, 470, and 502 hectares. Compute the median, mean, standard deviation, and range of these data "by hand."

The following values are the maximum gauge heights of the Bois Brule River in Brule, WI from 10-25Feb05. Compute the median, IQR, and range "by hand" and with R. Compute the mean and standard deviation with R. [*HINT: Create and then load data from a CSV file.*]

```
1.56 1.54 1.54 1.57 1.58 1.61 1.60 1.69
1.99 2.11 1.98 1.76 1.69 1.99 1.86 1.53

## Population Density in Wisconsin Counties
<img src="zimgs/Janesville.jpg" alt="Brule River" class="img-right">

The following values are the population density (number of people per acre of land) for 15 randomly selected Wisconsin counties. Compute the median, IQR, and range "by hand" and with R. Compute the mean and standard deviation with R. [*HINT: Create and then load data from a CSV file.*]

```
429.0  67.8  52.1  97.4  57.9 354.9  16.2  19.1
127.0  27.6  10.2  54.6  28.8  30.1  20.2

## Creatine Phosphate Concentrations
<img src="zimgs/creatine_phosphate.jpg" alt="Creatine Phosphate" class="img-right">

The table below contains the concentrations (International Units per liter) of creatine phosphokinase (an enzyme related to muscle and brain functions) in 36 male volunteers. Compute the median, IQR, and range "by hand" and with R. Compute the mean and standard deviation with R. Construct a histogram with R. [*HINT: Create and then load data from a CSV file.*]

## Air Pollution
<img src="zimgs/oil_refinery.jpg" alt="Oil Refinery Pollution" class="img-right">

The table below contains the carbon monoxide levels (ppm) arising from one of the stacks for an oil refinery northeast of San Francisco between April 16 and May 16, 1993.
