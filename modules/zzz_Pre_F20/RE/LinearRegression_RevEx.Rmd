## Molting of Wood Thrush
<img src="zimgs/thrush.jpg" alt="Wood Thrush" class="img-right">

[Vega Rivera *et al.* (1998)](https://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/wilson/v110n03/p0384-p0392.pdf) examined the relationship between the duration of molt and the date of molt start (measured in days since July 1) for wood thrush (*Hylocichla mustelina*). A recreation of their results is shown below (note that the outlier marked by a "+"" in the scatterplot was ignored in the calculation of the best-fit line). Use these results to answer the questions below.

```{r FLPThrush, echo=FALSE}
molt <- data.frame(date=c(61,60,58,53,53,51,51,49,48,46,46,47,45,43,43,42,41,41,39,38,37,35,38,35,34,33,34,30,28,30,30,21,24),

out <- molt[33,]
molt1 <- molt[-33,]

        xlab="Start Date (d since July 1)",ylab="Duration (d))")
points(out$date,out$duration,pch=3)
r2 <- formatC(rSquared(lm.molt),format="f",digits=3)
mtext(bquote(paste(Y==.(formatC(coef(lm.molt)[1],format="f",digits=3))-.(formatC(-1*coef(lm.molt)[2],format="f",digits=3))*X,"    ",r^2==.(r2))),line=0.2,cex=0.8)

## Age and Systolic Blood Pressure
<img src="zimgs/bloodpressure.jpg" alt="Blood Pressure" class="img-right">

The age (in years) and systolic blood pressure were measured for 32 white males over the age of 40. The researchers wanted to determine if systolic blood pressure increased with increasing age. Thus, they computed the regression depicted in the fitted-line plot below. Use these results to answer the questions below.

```{r FLPAgeSBP, echo=FALSE}
sbp1 <- data.frame(age=c(43,41,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,50,49,48,51,53,52,54,54,54,57,56,56,56,58,59,60,62,64,63,65,63,64),

## Deer Fawns
<img src="zimgs/fawn.jpg" alt="Fawn" class="img-right">

Wildlife ecologists in Texas wanted to determine if the number of fawns born to each doe could be explained by the doe's body mass [(Ginnett and Young 2000)](http://www.jstor.org/stable/3802741?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents). As part of their study, the researchers recorded the mean number of fawns born to a doe (over a period of time) and the body mass of the doe (kg).

## Fat Intake and Breast Cancer
<img src="zimgs/fat_intake.jpg" alt="Fat Intake" class="img-right">

[Carroll (1975)](http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/35/11_Part_2/3374.full.pdf) examined the relationship between per capita consumption of animal fat (g/day; `AnimFatI`) and age-adjusted death rate from breast cancer (`AgeAdjDe`) for 39 countries. Her goal was to determine if variability in the breast cancer death rate could be explained by the amount of fat consumed. The data for their study are found in [CancerFat.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/CancerFat.csv). Load these data into R and produce results that can be used to answer the questions below.

1. Which variable is the response variable?
1. What is an individual in this study?
1. In terms of the variables of this problem, what is the equation of the best-fit line?

## Willow Flycatcher Migration
<img src="zimgs/willow_flycatcher.jpg" alt="Willow Flycatcher" class="img-right">

[Yong and Finch (1997)](https://www.fs.fed.us/rmrs/publications/migration-willow-flycatcher-along-middle-rio-grande) hypothesized that larger Willow Flycatchers (*Empidonax traillii*) migrated up the Middle Rio Grande River earlier than small willow flycatchers. To test this hypothesis they captured flycatchers on several days during their migration and measured the wing length (mm; an index of overall body size) of each bird. They recorded the date that the bird was captured as a Julian date (days since Jan. 1).  The results of their study are found in [Flycatcher.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/Flycatcher.csv). Load these data into R and produce results that can be used to answer the questions below.

A modified version of their results are found in [RIFA.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/RIFA.csv).

## Math Assessments
<img src="zimgs/math_exam.jpg" alt="Math Exam" class="img-right">

All incoming freshmen are required to take a math assessment test to determine which math classes they should take. Sometimes pre-registering students will register before taking the assessment. To make the best possible course choices for these students, the adviser would like to predict their assessment score (`ASSESS`) based on their math ACT scores (`ACT`). The ACT score and assessment score from 72 freshmen from 2003 are stored in [NCAssess.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/NCAssess.csv). Load these data into R and produce results that can be used to answer the questions below.

1. What is the explanatory variable?
1. In terms of ACT and Assessment test scores, what does the value of the slope mean?
1. Mary Lamb had an ACT score of 40. Predict her assessment score.
1. John Tukey had an ACT score of 19. Predict his assessment score.
1. John Tukey actually scored a 15 on his assessment test. Calculate his residual?
1. What proportion of the variability in assessment score is explained by knowing the ACT score?
1. Do you think that these results provide a useful predictor of math assessment scores in cases where those scores are not available but ACT scores are? Explain.
1. What are the two most important assumptions in a regression analysis. Are these violated for this data set?  Why or why not?

## Fawn Recruitment and Precipitation
<img src="zimgs/fawn.jpg" alt="Fawns" class="img-right">

Wildlife ecologist in Texas wanted to determine if the amount of precipitation could explain some of the variability observed in the number of fawns born to each doe [(Ginnett and Young 2000)](http://www.jstor.org/stable/3802741?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents). Because Texas has many different climatic regions, the state was broken down into eight precipitation zones, and the mean precipitation for each zone over a period of five years was calculated. Furthermore, the researchers measured the mean number of fawns born per 100 does for each of these five years. The data for their study are found in [Deer1.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/Deer1.csv). Load these data into R and produce results that can be used to answer the questions below.

1. Express the equation of the best-fit line in terms of the variables of the problem.
1. Interpret the slope of the best-fit line in terms of the variables.
1. If the mean precipitation in an area were 1500 mm, how many fawns per 100 does would you expect?
1. If a precipitation zone has a mean precipitation of 1050 mm and an average of 37 fawns per 100 does, what is the residual of this zone?
1. What is the correlation coefficient between mean no. of fawns per 100 does and mean precipitation?
1. What proportion of the variability in the mean number of fawns per 100 does is explained by knowing the mean precipitation?
1. If the average amount of precipitation increases by 100 mm, how many more fawns per 100 does would you expect to be born?

<img src="zimgs/cricket.jpg" alt="Cricket" class="img-right">

It has been said that temperature can be estimated from the number of cricket chirps heard. To determine if this relationship existed, an entomologist recorded the number of chirps in a 15-second interval by crickets held at different temperatures. The data for their study are found in [Chirps.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/Chirps.csv). Load these data into R and produce results that can be used to answer the questions below.

1. What is the response variable?
1. What is the explanatory variable?
1. In terms of the variables of this problem, what is the equation of the best-fit line?
1. In terms of the variables of this problem, interpret the value of the slope.
1. If the number of chirps increases by 5, then how much different do you expect temperature to be?
1. If you hear 18 chirps during the day and 15 chirps at night, then how much different is the temperature, on average?
1. What is the residual when you hear 12 chirps and the temperature is 65 F?
1. What is the correlation coefficient between temperature and the number of chirps?
1. What proportion of the variability in temperature is explained by knowing the number of chirps?
1. Construct a residual plot and use it to interpret the validity of regression assumptions.
