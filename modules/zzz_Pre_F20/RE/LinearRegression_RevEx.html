<p><a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/rmrs/publications/migration-willow-flycatcher-along-middle-rio-grande">Yong and Finch (1997)</a> hypothesized that larger Willow Flycatchers (<em>Empidonax traillii</em>) migrated up the Middle Rio Grande River earlier than small willow flycatchers. To test this hypothesis they captured flycatchers on several days during their migration and measured the wing length (mm; an index of overall body size) of each bird. They recorded the date that the bird was captured as a Julian date (days since Jan. 1). The results of their study are found in <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/Flycatcher.csv">Flycatcher.csv</a>.

<h2>Math Assessments</h2>
<p><img src="zimgs/math_exam.jpg" alt="Math Exam" class="img-right"></p>
<p>All incoming freshmen are required to take a math assessment test to determine which math classes they should take. Sometimes pre-registering students will register before taking the assessment. To make the best possible course choices for these students, the adviser would like to predict their assessment score (<code>ASSESS</code>) based on their math ACT scores (<code>ACT</code>). The ACT score and assessment score from 72 freshmen from 2003 are stored in <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/NCAssess.csv">NCAssess.csv</a>.

<h2>Fawn Recruitment and Precipitation</h2>

<p>Wildlife ecologist in Texas wanted to determine if the amount of precipitation could explain some of the variability observed in the number of fawns born to each doe <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/3802741?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">(Ginnett and Young 2000)</a>. Because Texas has many different climatic regions, the state was broken down into eight precipitation zones, and the mean precipitation for each zone over a period of five years was calculated. Furthermore, the researchers measured the mean number of fawns born per 100 does for each of these five years.
