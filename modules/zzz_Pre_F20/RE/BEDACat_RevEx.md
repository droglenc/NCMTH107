## Religion and Genetic Counseling
<img src="zimgs/genetic_counseling.jpg" alt="Genetic Counseling" class="img-right">

[Weitz (1979)](https://asu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/barriers-to-acceptance-of-genetic-counseling-among-primary-care-p) conducted a survey of general and family practitioners, pediatricians, and obstetrician-gynecologists in the cities of Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona. In one part of the study, each physician was classified according to religion and whether they supported genetic counseling for parents or not. A summary of their responses for Jewish, Protestant, and Catholic physicians is shown in the table below. Use these results to answer the questions below.

|            | Suppot | Don't Support |
|:----------:|:------:|:-------------:|
|   Jewish   |   21   |       26      |
| Protestant |   36   |      142      |
|  Catholic  |   10   |       52      |


1. What percentage of Jewish physicians support genetic counseling?
1. What percentage of Catholic physicians don't support genetic counseling?
1. What percentage of all physicians surveyed were Protestant?
1. What percentage of those physicians not supporting genetic counseling were Catholic?
1. What percentage of all physicians supported genetic counseling?

## Herring Gulls
<img src="zimgs/Herring_Gull_Fledglings.jpg" alt="Herring Gull Fledglings" class="img-right">

The two-way table below depicts the results of an observational study concerned with the timing (i.e., month) of death for young (after fledging) Herring Gulls (*Larus argentatus*) in three locations. Each cell in the table is the number of dead herring gulls in each month-location combination. Use the table to answer the questions below. 

|             | July | August | September | October | November | December |
|:-----------:|:----:|:------:|:---------:|:-------:|:--------:|:--------:|
|  New Jersey |   4  |    7   |     19    |    9    |     2    |     1    |
| Netherlands |   4  |   28   |    130    |   150   |    61    |    32    |
|   England   |  10  |   60   |     89    |    39   |    31    |    12    |


1. What percentage of the gulls that died in New Jersey died in July?
1. What percentage of all gulls died in July?
1. What percentage of all gulls died in September and in The Netherlands?

## Elephant Seals
<img src="zimgs/ElephantSeals.jpg" alt="Elephant Seal" class="img-right">

Marine biologists studied the foraging ecology of Northern Elephant Seals off the California coast (LeBoeuf *et al.* 2000). Part of their analysis required that they record, for each observed seal, the month that it was observed and the sex of the seal. Their results from 47 seals are listed below. Use the data to answer the questions further below.

## Greenhouse Effect Opinion
<img src="zimgs/greenhouse_effect.jpg" alt="" class="img-right">

In the General Social Survey (GSS), two questions were asked -- "How often do you make a special effort to sort glass or cans or plastic or papers and so on for recycling?" and "In general, do you think that a rise in the world's temperature caused by the greenhouse effect, is extremely likely, very likely, somewhat likely, not very likely, or not at all likely?". Both of these variables are recorded in the [GSSEnviroQues.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/GSSEnviroQues.csv) file. Use these data to answer the questions below.

1. What percentage of all respondents recycle often and feel that it is very likely that the greenhouse effect has caused the rise in world's temperature?
1. What percentage of those respondents that recycle often feel that it is very likely that the greenhouse effect has caused the rise in world's temperature?
1. What percentage of those respondents that think it is very likely that the greenhouse effect has caused the rise in world's temperature also recycle often?
1. What percentage of all respondents recycle often?
1. What percentage of all respondents think it is very likely that the greenhouse effect has caused the rise in world's temperature?

## Animal Types in Zoos
<img src="zimgs/zoo.jpg" alt="Elephants" class="img-right">

The data in [Zoo1.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/Zoo1.csv) contains a list of animals found in several different zoos. In addition, each animal was classified into broad "types" ("mammal", "bird", and "amph/rep"). The researchers that collected these data wanted to examine if the distribution of broad animal types differed among zoos. Use these data to answer the questions below.

1. What is the response variable in this analysis?
1. What percentage of all animals were birds?
1. What percentage of animals in the Minnesota zoo were birds?
1. What percentage of animals in the Chicago zoo were amphibians/reptiles?
1. What percentage of animals were in the Chicago zoo?
1. What percentage of birds were in the Minnesota zoo?

## Rainfall in West Africa
<img src="zimgs/Africa_satellite.jpg" alt="Africa" class="img-right">

In an attempt to study rainfall patterns in West Africa caused by El Nino weather events, Nicholson and Kim (1997) constructed a two-way table that relates the number of days of rainfall that occurred each month to the amount of rain in inches that fell on those days (categorized as less than 1 inch and more than 1 inch). Use the modified version of their table below to answer the questions further below.
 
|        | < 1 in | > 1 in |
|:------:|:------:|:------:|
|  June  |    7   |    5   |
|  July  |   11   |    9   |
| August |   20   |   10   |


1. How many days did it rain in July?
1. In the months of June and August, how many days did it rain more than 1 inch?
1. What percentage of rainy days in August had less than 1 inch of precipitation?
1. If there are 31 days in July, on what percentage of those days did it rain?
1. What percentage of rainy days did more than 1 inch of rain fall?
1. What percentage of rainy days were in June?
