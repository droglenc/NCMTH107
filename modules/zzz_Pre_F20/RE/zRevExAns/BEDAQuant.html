<h2>Guess r</h2>
<ul>
<li>The scatterplots that most likely correspond to the given values of r are: 0.9 is B, -0.5 is D, -0.9 is H, 0.6 is C, and 0 is G.</li>

<h2>Hemlock and Deer</h2>
<p>The scatterplot between mean number of hemlock samplings and the deer browsing index is shown in Figure 1. The correlation coefficients is 0.97.</p>

<div id="metals-in-topsoil" class="section level2">
<h2>Metals in Topsoil</h2>
<p>The bivariate relationship between cadmium and copper in the topsoil at this site is linear, with a strong outlier at (18.1,76) and two weaker possible outliers at (2.6,81) and (8.2,47), with a positive association, and fairly strong. Strength was visually assessed from the scatterplot rather than using the correlation coefficient because of the presence of outliers.</p>

<div id="highway-and-city-mpg" class="section level2">
<h2>Highway and City MPG</h2>
<p>The bivariate relationship between highway and city gas mileage for Chevy Luminas is linear, with no obvious outliers, with a positive association, and strong (r=0.875). Strength was assessed with the correlation coefficient because the form is linear and there are no obvious outliers.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="red-imported-fire-ants-and-deer" class="section level2">
<h2>Red-Imported Fire Ants and Deer</h2>
<p>The relationship between the fawn recruitment and the index of red-imported fire ants (Figure 2) is linear, with no obvious outliers, with a negative association, and moderately strong (r=-0.70). Strength was assessed with the correlation coefficient because the relationship is linear with no obvious outliers.</p>

<div id="yellow-perch-length-weight" class="section level2">
<h2>Yellow Perch Length-Weight</h2>
<p>The relationship between the weight and total length of Grafton Lake Yellow Perch (Figure 3) is nonlinear, with no obvious outliers, a positive association, and strong. Strength was assessed visually from the scatterplot rather than with the correlation coefficient because the relationship is nonlinear.</p>

<div id="crickets-and-temperature" class="section level2">
<h2>Crickets and Temperature</h2>
<p>The relationship between temperature and number of chirps by a cricket (Figure 4) is linear, with no obvious outliers, a positive association, and strong (r=0.83). It is also worth noting that the relationship appears to get weaker as the number of chirps decreases. Strength was assessed with the correlation coefficient because the relationship is linear with no obvious outliers.</p>

<div id="wolves-and-whitetail-deer" class="section level2">
<h2>Wolves and Whitetail Deer</h2>
<p>The relationship between the Wolf territory size and density of Whitetail Deer (Figure 5) is linear (though I could see where someone would say that it is very slightly curved), with no obvious outliers, a negative association, and moderately strong (r=-0.79). Strength was assessed with the correlation coefficient because the relationship is linear with no obvious outliers.</p>
