<h2>Length of Northern Pike</h2>
<ol>
<li>α = 0.05. (<em>Note that this is obtained from working backwards from the 95% confidence statement.</em>)</li>
<li>H<sub>0</sub>: μ = 600, H<sub>A</sub>: μ ≠ 600 where μ is the mean length of all pike in Chivyrkui Bay, Lake Baikal.</li>
<li>A one-sample Z-test is required because a (i) quantitative variable (length) was measured, (ii) individuals from only one group/population were sampled (Chivyrkui Bay, Lake Baikal), and (iii) σ is known (given in the background).</li>
<li>Observational study with n = 30 pike. No obvious randomization.</li>
<li>n = 30 ≥ 15 and the population is not strongly skewed (background says “slightly”" right-skewed); σ is known.</li>
<li>x¯ = 656.1.</li>
<li>Z = <span class="math inline">\(\frac{656.1-600}{\frac{130}{\sqrt{30}}}\)</span> = 2.363.</li>
<li>The p-value is 0.0181.</li>
<li>Reject H<sub>0</sub> because the p-value&lt;α.</li>
<li>The true mean length of all pike in Lake Baikal appears to be greater than 600 mm. (<em>You strictly tested for a difference, but the x¯ clearly shows that the mean length is greater than 600 mm.</em>)</li>
<li>One is 95% confident that the true mean length of all pike in Lake Baikal is between 609.6 and 702.6 mm (from 656.1 ± 1.96*23.74, 656.1 ± 46.53). This further supports that the mean length of Lake Baikal pike is greater than 600 mm.</li>

<h2>Chronic Myofascial Pain Syndrome</h2>
<ol>
<li>α = 0.10.</li>
<li>H<sub>0</sub>: μ = 2.5, H<sub>A</sub>: μ &gt; 2.5 where μ is the mean length of pain.</li>
<li>A one-sample Z-test is required because (i) a quantitative variable (length of pain) was measured, (ii) individuals from only one group/population were sampled (patients with this syndrome), and (iii) σ is known (given in the background).</li>
<li>An observational study that is not obviously random was used.</li>
<li>The population is normally distributed (given in the background) and σ is known (= 0.5). Thus, the test statistic below should follow a normal distribution.</li>
<li>x¯ = 2.77 years (Table 1).</li>
<li>Z = 1.31 (Table 1).</li>
<li>p-value = 0.0957 (Table 1).</li>
<li>Reject H<sub>0</sub> because the p-value&lt;α.</li>
<li>It appears that the mean duration of pain for all patients may be longer than 2.5 years.</li>
<li>One is 90% confident that the mean duration of pain for all patients is more than 2.51 years (Table 1), which further supports (just barely) that the mean is greater than 2.5.</li>

<h2>Cholesterol Levels</h2>
<ol>
<li>α = 0.10.</li>
<li>H<sub>0</sub>: μ = 190, H<sub>A</sub>: μ ≠ 190 where μ is the mean cholesterol level of Asian women.</li>
<li>A one-sample Z-test is required because (i) a quantitative variable (cholesterol level) was measured, (ii) individuals from only one group/population were sampled (Asian women aged 21-40 that had recently immigrated to the U.S.), and (iii) σ is known (given in the background).</li>
