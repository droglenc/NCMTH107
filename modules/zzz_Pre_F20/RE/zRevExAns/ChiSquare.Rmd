1. The H<sub>0</sub>: "The proportion of fish from the Cyprinidae family is the same for all three rivers" versus H<sub>A</sub>: "The proportion of fish from the Cyprinidae family is NOT the same for all three rivers."
1. A chi-square test is required because (i) a categorical variable with two levels (cyprinidae and other) was measured on (ii) three groups/populations (rivers).
1. The data appear to be part of an observational study. There is no indication that the fish were randomly selected (they likely were not, though hopefully the locations for collecting the fish were).
1. The expected frequencies are in (`r tabs("CyprinidExp",display="cite")`). The test statistic below should follow a &chi;<sup>2</sup> distribution because the expected number in each cell is greater than five.
1. The appropriate statistic is the observed frequency table in (`r tabs("CyprinidObs",display="cite")`).
1. The &chi;<sup>2</sup> test statistic is $\frac{(22-24.65351)^{2}}{24.65351}$ + $\frac{(51-48.34649)^{2}}{48.34649}$ + $\frac{(25-26.34211)^{2}}{26.34211}$ + $\frac{(53-51.65789)^{2}}{51.65789}$ + $\frac{(30-26.00439)^{2}}{26.00439}$ + $\frac{(47-50.99561)^{2}}{50.99561}$ = 0.2856027 + 0.06837899 + 0.6139323 + 0.1456385 + 0.03486876 + 0.3130648 = 1.4615 with (2-1) &times; (3-1) = 2 df.
1. The p-value is `r kPvalue(chi1$p.value,include.p=FALSE,latex=FALSE)`.
1. The null hypothesis is not rejected because the p-value > &alpha;.
1. There is no apparent difference in the proportion of fish from Cyprinidae family among the three rivers (`r tabs("CyprinidPerc",display="cite")`).

1. The H<sub>0</sub>: "The proportion of nurses with HEE is the same amoung the four types of hospitals" verus H<sub>A</sub>: "The proportion of nurses with HEE is NOT the same amoung the four types of hospitals".
1. A chi-square test is required because (i)a categorical variable with two levels (HEE and not HEE) was measured on (ii) four groups/populations (types of hospitals).
1. The data appear to be part of an observational study. There is no indication that the individuals were randomly selected.
1. The expected frequencies are in `r tabs("NurseExp",display="cite")`. The test statistic below should follow a &chi;<sup>2</sup> distribution because the expected number in each cell is greater than five.
1. The statistic is the observed frequency table in `r tabs("NurseObs",display="cite")`.

1. The H<sub>0</sub> is rejected because the p-value < &alpha;.
1. There is a significant difference in the proportion of nurses experiencing HEE among the four hospitals. The prevalance of HEE appears to be greater in the non-ANCC clinics `r tabs("NursePerc",display="cite")`.

1. &alpha; = 0.05.
1. The H<sub>0</sub>: "The proportion of patients that died in the hospital is the same for men and women" versus H<sub>A</sub>: "The proportion of patients that died in the hospital is NOT the same for men and women"
1. A chi-square test is required because (i)a categorical variable with two levels (died and survived) was measured on (ii) two groups/populations (men and women).
1. An observation study that is very likely not a simple random sample was used.
1. The expected number of individuals in each cell is in `r tabs("MIExp",display="cite")`. The test statistic below should follow a &chi;<sup>2</sup> distribution because expected number in each cell is greater than five.

1. The H<sub>0</sub> is rejected because the p-value < &alpha;.

1. A chi-square test is required because (i)a categorical variable with two levels (favor or don't favor uniforms) was measured on (ii) two groups/populations (students and parents).
1. An observation study that is obviously not a simple random sample (it is a convenience sample of both groups).
1. The test statistic below should follow a &chi;<sup>2</sup> distribution because the expected number in each cell of `r tabs("UniformExp",display="cite")` is greater than five.
1. The table of observed values is in `r tabs("UniformObs",display="cite")`.

1. The H<sub>0</sub>: "The proportion of dolphin groups in each activity type is the same among the times of day" versus H<sub>A</sub>: "The proportion of dolphin groups in each activity type is NOT the same among the times of day."
1. A chi-square test is required because (i)a categorical variable with three levels (activity type) was measured on (ii) four groups (times of day).
1. An observational study that is not obviously a random sample was used.
1. The test statistic below may not follow a &chi;<sup>2</sup> distribution because the expected number in each cell is NOT greater than five (`r tabs("DolphinExp",display="cite")`).

1. &alpha;=0.01.
1. H<sub>0</sub>: "The proportion of animals that are infected is the same for whitetail deer, mule deer, and elk" versus H<sub>A</sub>: "The proportion of animals that are infected is NOT the same for whitetail deer, mule deer, and elk."
1. A chi-square test is required because (i)a categorical variable with two levels (diseased or not) was measured on (ii) three groups/populations (species).
1. An observation study that is likely not a simple random sample.
1. The test statistic below should follow a &chi;<sup>2</sup> distribution because the expected number in each cell is greater than five (`r tabs("CervidsExp",display="cite")`).
1. The table of observed values is in `r tabs("CervidsObs",display="cite")`.
1. The &chi;<sup>2</sup> test statistic is `r formatC(chi1$statistic,format="f",digits=3)` with `r chi1$parameter` df.
1. The p-value for this test statistic is `r kPvalue(chi1$p.value,include.p=FALSE,latex=FALSE)`.
1. The H<sub>0</sub> is rejected because the because p-value < &alpha;.
1. There is very strong evidence of a difference in the disease rate among the three species. There is evidence that elk are more diseased than the other two species (`r tabs("CervidsPerc",display="cite")`).
1. Not needed for a chi-square test.

## Why Americans Do Not Exercise
```{r echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
ex <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/Exercise.csv")

```

1. &alpha; = 0.01.
1. The H<sub>0</sub>: "The distribution of individuals into reasons for not exercising is the same for men and women" versus H<sub>A</sub>: "The distribution of individuals into reasons for not exercising is NOT the same for men and women."
1. A chi-square test is required because (i)a categorical variable with six levels (reasons) was measured on (ii) two groups/populations (men and women).
1. The data appear to be part of an observational study where the individuals in both groups/populations were randomly selected.
1. The test statistic below should follow a &chi;<sup>2</sup> distribution because the expected number in each cell is greater than five (`r tabs("ExerciseExp",display="cite")`).
1. The table of observed values is in `r tabs("ExerciseObs",display="cite")`.
1. The &chi;<sup>2</sup> test statistic is `r formatC(chi1$statistic,format="f",digits=3)` with `r chi1$parameter` df.
1. The p-value for this test statistic is `r kPvalue(chi1$p.value,include.p=FALSE,latex=FALSE)`.
1. The null hypothesis is rejected because the p-value < &alpha;.
1. There appears to be a significant difference in the reasons why men and women don't exercise. The major differences appears to be in the "in good health" and "too lazy" categories where men are more likely to cite "in good health" as a reason and women are more likely to cite "too lazy" (`r tabs("ExercisePerc",display="cite")`).
1. Not needed for a chi-square test.

## Types of Animals in Different Zoos

```

1. &alpha; = 0.05.
1. The H<sub>0</sub>: "The proportion of animals in the broad animal types is the same for each zoo" versus H<sub>A</sub>: "The proportion of animals in the broad animal types is NOT the same for each zoo."
1. A chi-square test is required because categorical variable with three levels (broad animal type) was measured on (ii) four groups/populations (zoos).
1. An observational study that is not a simple random sample.
1. The test statistic below should follow a &chi;<sup>2</sup> distribution because the expected number in each cell is greater than five (`r tabs("ZooExp",display="cite")`).
1. The table of observed values is in `r tabs("ZooObs",display="cite")`.
1. The &chi;<sup>2</sup> test statistic is `r formatC(chi1$statistic,format="f",digits=3)` with `r chi1$parameter` df.
1. The p-value for this test statistic is `r kPvalue(chi1$p.value,include.p=FALSE,latex=FALSE)`.
1. The H<sub>0</sub> is rejected because the p-value < &alpha;.
1. There appears to be a difference in the proportion of animals in the animal types among the zoos. It appears that the major differences are that the San Antonio zoo has more amphibians/reptiles and fewer mammals than would be expected and the Minnesota and San Diego zoos have more mammals than would be expected (`r tabs("ZooPerc",display="cite")`).
1. Not needed for a chi-square test.
