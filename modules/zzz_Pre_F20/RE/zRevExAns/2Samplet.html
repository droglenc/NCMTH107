<li>A two-sample t-test is required because (i) a quantitative variable (kernels unpopped) was measured, (ii) two groups/populations (yellow and white) exist, and (iii) those populations were independent (there is no connection between all of the individuals of white corn and those of yellow corn).</li>
<li>The data appear to be part of an observational study with the individuals randomly selected.</li>
<li>Individuals in the groups/populations are independent (as stated above). The sample size (n<sub>w</sub>+n<sub>y</sub>=60) is ≥ 40. The population variances appear to be equal because the p-value for Levene’s test (given as 0.972) is “large” (i.e., &gt; α). Therefore, the test statistic computed below should reasonably follow a t-distribution with n<sub>w</sub>+n<sub>y</sub>-2 = 58 df.</li>

<li>The test statistic is t = <span class="math inline">\(\frac{0.700-0}{1.154}\)</span> = 0.606 with 58 df.</li>
<li>The p-value is 0.5469.</li>
<li>The H<sub>0</sub> is not rejected because p-value &gt; α.</li>
<li>There does not appear to be a difference in the mean number of unpopped kernels between the white and yellow varieties.</li>
<li>One is 90% confident that the difference in mean number of unpopped kernels between the white and yellow varieties is between -1.610 and 3.010 (as computed with 0.700±2.002*1.154). This further illustrates that there is not a difference in mean number of unpopped kernels between the white and yellow varieties (because 0 is in the confidence region).</li>

<li>A two-sample t-test is required because (i) a quantitative variable (BTUs) was measured, (ii) two groups/populations (electric and thermal vents) exist, and (iii) those populations were independent (there is no connection between all of the vents in the two groups).</li>
<li>The data are part of an observational study where it is not obvious that the devices were randomly allocated to houses.</li>
<li>The individuals in the two groups are independent (no vent was placed in the same house). The sample size (n<sub>e</sub>+n<sub>t</sub> = 90) is ≥ 40. The population variances appear to be equal because the p-value for Levene’s test of the homogeneity of variance test (given as 0.996) is “large” (i.e., &gt; α).

<li>The statistic is x̄<sub>e</sub>-x̄<sub>t</sub> = 9.908 - 10.143 = -0.235.

<li>One is 90% confident that the difference in average BTUs between houses equipped with the electrically and the thermally activated vent is between -0.875 and 0.405 (as computed with -0.235±1.662*0.385). This further indicates that there is no difference in average BTUs between houses equipped with the electrically and the thermally activated vent (as 0 is in the confidence region).</li>

The H<sub>A</sub>:μ<sub>L</sub>-μ<sub>UL</sub>&lt;0 (representing that the lined cartons will reduce the dioxin level).</li>
<li>A two-sample t-test is required because (i) a quantitative variable (dioxin level) was measured, (ii) two groups/populations (cartons with and without foil) exist, and (iii) those populations were independent (there is no connection between all of the cartons in the two groups).</li>
<li>The data appear to be part of an observational study; however there is no mention of randomization in this study although it would have been easy to randomly select cartons.</li>
<li>The individuals in the two groups are independent (cartons could not be both linead and unlined). The sample size (n<sub>L</sub>+n<sub>UL</sub>=100) is ≥ 40. The variances appear to be UNequal because the Levene’s test p-value (&lt;0.00005) is less than α.

Histograms constructed for both groups (Figure 1) suggested a right-skewness but not an overly strong skew (this is very difficult to ascertain because of the small sample size). The population variances appear to be equal because the Levene’s test p-value (0.9195) is larger than α.
