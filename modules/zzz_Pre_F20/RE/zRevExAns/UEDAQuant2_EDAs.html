<div id="time-spent-playing-video-games" class="section level2">
<h2>Time Spent Playing Video Games</h2>
<p>The time spent playing video games is very strongly right-skewed with an extreme outlier at 30 hours and another outlier at approximately 15 hours. The center is at a median of 0 hours and the dispersion is from a Q1 of 0 hours to a Q3 of 1.2 hours. The median and IQR were used because of the skew and presence of outliers. [<em>Results are derived from the figure and table presented in the question.</em>]</p>

<div id="bank-transaction-times" class="section level2">
<h2>Bank Transaction Times</h2>
<p>The bank transaction times are strongly right-skewed with no obvious outliers. The center is at a median of 93.0 hours and the dispersion is from a Q1 of 60.3 hours to a Q3 of 145.2 hours. The median and IQR were used because of the skew and presence of outliers. [<em>Results are derived from the figure and table presented in the question.</em>]</p>

<div id="creatine-phosphate-concentrations" class="section level2">
<h2>Creatine Phosphate Concentrations</h2>
<p>The distribution of creatine phosphate concentrations is slightly right-skewed with no obvious outliers (Figure 1). The center is at a mean of 98.3 and the dispersion is a standard deviation of 40.4 (Table 1). The mean and standard deviation were used because the distribution was not strongly skewed and outliers were not present. [<em>Note that I did not call the individuals above 200 outliers because they were only one bar removed, there were two individuals, and they “felt” like an extension of the right-tail.</em>]</p>

<div id="air-pollution" class="section level2">
<h2>Air Pollution</h2>
<p>The distribution of carbon monoxide levels arising from the oil refinery stack is strongly right-skewed with a possible outlier at 261 ppm (Figure 2). The center is at a median of 58.0 and the dispersion is from a Q1 of 41.0 to a Q3 of 85.5 (Table 2). The median and IQR were used because the distribution was strongly skewed and an outlier was present.</p>

<h2>Dow Jones</h2>
<p>The distribution of the May, 1996 Dow Jones Travel Index is strongly right-skewed with no obvious outliers present (Figure 3). The center is at a median of 130.0 and the dispersion is from a Q1 of 118.0 to a Q3 of 154.2 (Table 3). The median and IQR were used because the distribution was strongly skewed.</p>

<h2>Zoo Sizes</h2>
<p>The distribution of the physical size of zoos is strongly right-skewed with possible outliers between 500 and 600 acres (Figure 4). The center is at a median of 43.5 acres and the dispersion is from a Q1 of 15.0 to a Q3 of 90.0 acres (Table 4). The median and IQR were used because the distribution was strongly skewed and there were possible outliers.</p>
