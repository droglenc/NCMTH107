<div id="drinking-water-source" class="section level2">
<h2>Drinking Water Source</h2>
<p>The approximate frequency table is shown below.</p>
<pre><code>      Groundwater    Lake/Reservoir             River           Muliple 
              119               219                72               118 
       Don&#39;t Know Refused to Answer 
              221                 2 </code></pre>
<p>A very large number of respondents did not know where their water supply was derived. Of those that did, most were derived from a lake or reservoir, with about the same number evenly split between groundwater and multiple sources.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="curbside-recycling" class="section level2">
<h2>Curbside Recycling</h2>
<p>More than half of the respondents felt that the curbside recycling program has reduced their waste by approximately 25%, with approximately another third saying approximately 50% (Table 1). The only other response offered was “too early to tell.”</p>
<p>Table 1: Percentage table for how much curbside recycling has reduced overall refuse. Note that B=25%, C=50%, and E=‘too early to tell’.</p>
<pre><code>recycle
   B    C    E 
55.6 36.5  7.9 </code></pre>

<div id="zoo-animal-types" class="section level2">
<h2>Zoo Animal Types</h2>
<p>Animals were nearly evenly split among the three categories, with somewhat more birds and somewhat fewer amphibian/reptiles (Table 3).</p>
<p>Table 2: Percentage table of animal types in a sample of several national zoos.</p>
<pre><code>type
