<li>The H<sub>0</sub>: “The proportion of sub-habitat used by shrikes is the same the proportion of habitat available” versus H<sub>A</sub>: “The proportion of sub-habitat used by shrikes is NOT the same the proportion of habitat available.”</li>
<li>A goodness-of-fit test is required because (i) a categorical variable (habitat type) with four levels from (ii) a single group/population (these shrikes) was recorded and (iii) the frequency of individuals in each level is being compared to a theoretical distribution in the null hypothesis.</li>
<li>The data appear to be part of an observational study where the individuals were not randomly selected but the location to look for the individuals was.</li>
<li>The expected frequencies are equal to the total number of observations times the proportion of each habitat type available. For example, the expected number of shrikes in the settled sub-habitat is 1456 × 0.205 = 298.48. The expectations for the other habitats are computed similarly and are in Table 1. There is more than five individuals in each of the four levels of the expected table. Thus, the test statistic below should follow a χ<sup>2</sup> distribution.</li>
<li>The observed frequencies are in Table 1.</li>
<li>The χ<sup>2</sup> test statistic is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{(149-298.48)^{2}}{298.48} + \frac{(944-853.216)^{2}}{853.216} + \frac{(192-149.968)^{2}}{149.968} + \frac{(171-154.336)^{2}}{154.336}\)</span> = 74.860 + 9.660 + 11.780 + 1.799 = 98.099, with 4-1=3 df.</li>
<li>The p-value is &lt;0.00005.</li>
<li>The H<sub>0</sub> is rejected because the p-value &lt; α.</li>
<li>The shrikes found in the open habitat do not use the sub-habitats in proportion to the availability of the sub-habitat. In particular, they appear to use the settled sub-habitat less and the two pasture sub-habitats more than expected (Table 2).</li>

<li>A goodness-of-fit test is required because (i) a categorical variable (type of fish) with only two levels from (ii) a single group/population (the catch from that area) was recorded and (iii) the frequency results are being compared to a theoretical distribution in the null hypothesis.</li>
<li>An observational study of n=1256 randomly selected fish was used.</li>
<li>Under the null hypothesis the expected proportions are 0.10 for King Salmon and 0.90 for all other fishes (Table 19). From this it is seen that each expected frequency is greater than five. Thus the test statistic below should follow a χ<sup>2</sup> distribution.</li>

<li>A goodness-of-fit test is required because (i) a categorical variable (sex) with two levels from (ii) a single group/population (road-killed otters in Britain) was recorded and (iii) the frequency of individuals in each sex is being compared to a theoretical distribution.</li>
<li>The data appear to be part of an observational study that is not random; rather it is a convenience collection.</li>
<li>Under the null hypothesis of no sex-bias one would expect the same proportion of individuals in each level. Thus, the expected frequencies are the sample size divided by 2 (Table 21). From this it is seen that each expected frequency has more than five individuals. Thus, the test statistic below should follow a χ<sup>2</sup> distribution.</li>
