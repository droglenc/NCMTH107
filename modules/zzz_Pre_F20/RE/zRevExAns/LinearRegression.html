<h2>Molting of Wood Thrush</h2>
<ol>
<li>The explanatory variable is start date.</li>
<li>The response variable is duration.</li>
<li>The equation of the best-fit line is Duration = 70.296-0.445*Start Date.</li>
<li>For each day later that the thrush starts molting the duration of the molt will be 0.445 days <strong>shorter</strong>, on average.</li>
<li>If the start date equals zero (July 1st), then the duration of the molt will be 70.296, on average.</li>
<li>This prediction should not be made because 71 days since July 1 is outside the domain of the data.</li>
<li>The predicted molt duration is 51.161 d, on average (70.296-0.445*43). Thus, the residual is -3.161 d (48-51.161).</li>
<li>The correlation coefficient is <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>=0.863 (i.e., square root of <span class="math inline">\(r^{2}\)</span>)</li>
<li>The proportion of variability explained by knowing start date (regardless of start date) is <span class="math inline">\(r^{2}\)</span>=0.744.</li>
<li>The proportion of variability explained by knowing start date (regardless of start date) is <span class="math inline">\(r^{2}\)</span>=0.744.</li>
<li>The slope would get closer to zero as the outlier would pull the line towards it, thus flattening the line out.</li>

<div id="age-and-systolic-blood-pressure" class="section level2">
<h2>Age and Systolic Blood Pressure</h2>
<ol>
<li>The explanatory varible is age (<code>AGE</code>).</li>
<li>The response variable is systolic blood pressure (<code>SBP</code>).</li>
<li>The equation of the best-fit line is SBP=59.389+1.601AGE.</li>
<li>If the age is 0, then the systolic blood pressure will be 59.389, on average.</li>
<li>For each one year increase in AGE, SBP increases by 1.601 units, on average.</li>
<li>Male A will have a SBP that is 4.803 lower than Male B (<em>i.e., 3 slopes</em>).</li>
<li>This prediction should not be made as 70 is outside the domain of the data.</li>
<li>The residual for this individual is -8.439 (i.e., 131 - (59.389+1.601*50)).</li>
<li>The correlation coefficient is 0.775 (the square root of <span class="math inline">\(r^{2}\)</span>=0.600).</li>
<li>The proportion of variability explained is <span class="math inline">\(r^{2}\)</span>=0.600.</li>

<h2>TV Ratings</h2>
<ol>
<li>The response variable is the size of the audience.</li>
<li>The equation of the best-fit line is Audience = -9610.463+982.541*Rating</li>
<li>For each 1% increase in rating the audience size will increase 982.541 (1000s), on average.</li>
<li>This prediction should not be made as 40.1% is outside the domain of the data.</li>
<li>The residual in this case is -23650.22 (i.e., 40000 - (9610.463+982.541*55)).</li>
<li>The proportion of varibility explained by knowing the rating value is <span class="math inline">\(r^{2}\)</span>=0.331</li>
<li>The correlation coefficient is <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>=0.575.</li>
<li>I am concerned that the fitted-line plot exhibits a curvature and a funnel-shape suggesting that both the linearity and homoscedasticity assumptions have been violated.</li>

<div id="deer-fawns" class="section level2">
<h2>Deer Fawns</h2>
<ol>
<li>The explanatory variable is body mass of does.</li>
<li>The response variable is mean fawns per doe.</li>
<li>The equation of the best-fit line is Fawns = 1.960+0.0088Mass</li>
<li>As the mass of the doe increases by 1 kg, then the number of fawns born will increase by 0.0088, on average.</li>
<li>This prediction cannot be made because 45 kg is outside the range of observed body masses.</li>
<li>The residual is -0.342 (i.e., 1.9-(1.960+0.0088*32))</li>
<li>The correlation coefficient is 0.045.</li>
<li>The proportion of variability explained by knowing the doe’s body mass is 0.002.</li>
<li>If body mass increases by 5 kg, then the mean number of fawns born to the doe would increase by 0.044 (i.e., 5*0.0088).</li>
<li>There does not appear to be a lack of linearity or heteroscedasticity in the fitted-line plot. However, it is an extremely weak relationship to be basing predictions on.</li>

<div id="fat-intake-and-breast-cancer" class="section level2">
<h2>Fat Intake and Breast Cancer</h2>
<ol>
<li>The explanatory variable is the amount of animal fat ingested (<code>fatintake</code>).</li>
<li>An individual is a country.</li>
<li>The equation of the best-fit line is adjdeath = -3.696 + 0.175*fatintake.</li>
<li>The interpretation of the slope is that for every increase of 1 g/day consumption of animal fat the per capita death rate due to breast cancer will increase 0.175 units, on average.</li>
<li>Because of the interpretation of the slope, country A will have an age adjusted death rate due to breast cancer that is (-4)*0.175 = -14.784 units <strong>lower</strong> than country B, on average.</li>
<li>This question cannot be answered because 170 g/day is outside the range of the <code>fatintake</code> data used to construct the relationship.</li>
<li>The residual is 2.4.</li>
<li>The correlation coefficient is 0.949 and is found by taking the square root of <span class="math inline">\(r^{2}\)</span>.</li>
<li>This is simply a definition of <span class="math inline">\(r^{2}\)</span>=0.900.</li>
<li>No, you cannot say that the intake of animal fat is the CAUSE for the increase in age adjusted death rate because these data were not collected from an experiment. Causal statements cannot be made from observational studies (which this one obviously is) because many other unmonitored or lurking variables may explain the relationship.</li>

<li>The equation of the best-fit line is winglen = 91.070-0.156date.</li>
<li>When the date is 0 (January 1), then the wing length will be 91.070 mm, on average.</li>
<li>For each day increase in the migration, the average wing length decreases by 0.156 mm.</li>
<li>This is 10 times the unit change in length by day. Thus, 10*-0.156 = -1.56.</li>

<li>For every 1 unit increase in RIFA the fawn recruitment index <strong>declines</strong> by 0.000209 units, on average.</li>
