Probability is the "language" used by statisticians to describe the proportion of time that a random event will occur.  The language of probability is at the center of statistical inference.  Thus, at least a basic understanding of probability is critical to understanding inferential statistical methods.  This module provides a very brief introduction to probability.

<p>After completing this module, you should be able to ...</p>

<ol>
  <li>Identify the two major assumptions for computing basic probabilities.</li>
  <li>Calculate basic probabilities in discrete item cases.</li>
  <li>Calculate basic probabilities for continuous variables that follow a normal distribution.</li>
</ol>
