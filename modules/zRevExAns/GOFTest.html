<h2>Shrike Habitat Use</h2>
<ol>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> = 0.05.</li>
<li>The <span class="math inline">\(H_{0}\)</span>: “The proportion of sub-habitat used by shrikes is the same the proportion of habitat available” versus <span class="math inline">\(H_{A}\)</span>: “The proportion of sub-habitat used by shrikes is NOT the same the proportion of habitat available.”</li>
<li>A goodness-of-fit test is required because (i) a categorical variable (habitat type) with four levels from (ii) a single group/population (these shrikes) was recorded and (iii) the frequency of individuals in each level is being compared to a theoretical distribution in the null hypothesis.</li>
<li>The data appear to be part of an observational study where the individuals were not randomly selected but the location to look for the individuals was.</li>
<li>The expected frequencies are equal to the total number of observations times the proportion of each habitat type available. For example, the expected number of shrikes in the settled sub-habitat is 1456 <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> 0.205 = 298.48. The expectations for the other habitats are computed similarly and are in Table 1. There is more than five individuals in each of the four levels of the expected table. Thus, the test statistic below should follow a <span class="math inline">\(\chi^{2}\)</span> distribution.</li>
<li>The observed frequencies are in Table 1.</li>
<li>The <span class="math inline">\(\chi^{2}\)</span> test statistic is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{(149-298.48)^{2}}{298.48} + \frac{(944-853.216)^{2}}{853.216} + \frac{(192-149.968)^{2}}{149.968} + \frac{(171-154.336)^{2}}{154.336}\)</span> = 74.860 + 9.660 + 11.780 + 1.799 = 98.099, with 4-1=3 df.</li>
<li>The p-value is <span class="math inline">\(&lt;0.00005\)</span>.</li>
<li>The <span class="math inline">\(H_{0}\)</span> is rejected because the p-value <span class="math inline">\(&lt;\alpha\)</span>.</li>
<li>The shrikes found in the open habitat do not use the sub-habitats in proportion to the availability of the sub-habitat. In particular, they appear to use the settled sub-habitat less and the two pasture sub-habitats more than expected (Table 2).</li>

<li>A goodness-of-fit test is required because (i) a categorical variable (color and wrinkliness combination) with four levels from (ii) a single group/population (this ear of corn) was recorded and (iii) the observed frequency of individuals is being compared to a theoretical distribution in the null hypothesis.</li>
<li>The data appear to be part of a quasi-experimental study where the individuals were not randomly selected but the location on the corn cob where the individuals were selected was randomly located.</li>

<li>A goodness-of-fit test is required because (i) a categorical variable (survived or not) with six levels from (ii) a single group/population (one population of deer) was recorded and (iii) the frequency of results is being compared to a theoretical distribution in the null hypothesis.</li>
<li>The data appear to be part of an observational study where the individuals were apparently randomly selected.</li>
<li>The expected frequency for the first group comes from solving for <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> in $X+(0.5<sup>{1}+0.5</sup>{2}+0.5<sup>{3}+0.5</sup>{4}+0.5^{5})X = $ 253 or 1.96875X = 253 or X = 128.508. The remaining expected frequencies come from applying consecutive survival rates of 0.5 to the successive ages (Table 17). From this it is seen that each expected frequency does NOT contain more than five individuals. However, only one cell has a value less than five and that cell is only one individual short of the recommended value of five. Thus, the test statistic below will likely reasonably follow a <span class="math inline">\(\chi^{2}\)</span> distribution.</li>
<li>The observed frequencies are in Table 17.</li>

<li>The null hypothesis is not rejected because the p-value <span class="math inline">\(&gt;\alpha\)</span>.</li>
<li>The observed data appear to be consistent with a survival rate of 50%. This result may also be observed by noting that all expected frequencies are contained within all 95% confidence intervals in Table 18.</li>

<li>A goodness-of-fit test is required because (i) a categorical variable (type of fish) with only two levels from (ii) a single group/population (the catch from that area) was recorded and (iii) the frequency results are being compared to a theoretical distribution in the null hypothesis.</li>
<li>An observational study of n=1256 randomly selected fish was used.</li>
<li>Under the null hypothesis the expected proportions are 0.10 for King Salmon and 0.90 for all other fishes (Table 19). From this it is seen that each expected frequency is greater than five.

<li>A goodness-of-fit test is required because (i) a categorical variable (sex) with two levels from (ii) a single group/population (road-killed otters in Britain) was recorded and (iii) the frequency of individuals in each sex is being compared to a theoretical distribution.</li>
<li>The data appear to be part of an observational study that is not random; rather it is a convenience collection.</li>
<li>Under the null hypothesis of no sex-bias one would expect the same proportion of individuals in each level. Thus, the expected frequencies are the sample size divided by 2 (Table 21).
