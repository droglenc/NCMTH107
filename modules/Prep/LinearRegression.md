1. What are the two goals of a linear regression analysis.
1. Define explanatory and response variables.
1. On which axes are the response and explanatory variable placed?
1. Write the generic equation of the line and define each "letter" in that equation.
1. Specifically define slope and intercept.
1. What statistical word must be used when describing both the slope and the intercept? Why?
1. What is the value of the slope in the equation G=3.73*K+14.4? What is the value of the intercept in the same equation.
1. What is the value of the slope in the equation H=-13.56-8.93*V? What is the value of the intercept in the same equation.
1. How does one predict the value of the response variable given the equation of a line and a value of the explanatory variable.
1. What is an extrapolation?
1. What is a residual (definitionally and visually) and how is it computed?
1. Define RSS and explain how it is used to find the "best-fit line."
1. What are the two assumptions of linear regression that will be focused on in this course?
1. Sketch scatterplots that show when each of the two assumptions of linear regression are and are not violated.
1. Define the coefficient of determination, include what symbol is used to represent it.
1. How does the value of the coefficient of determination change with increasing strength of the linear relationship?
1. What are the twelve questions that are usually asked for in a linear regression analysis?
1. What questions do you have from this reading that you would like me to address? [*Please be as specific as possible. Don't just say "everything" or "I don't understand anything." Of course, you can ask questions about the reading before class on MS Teams (see link above).*]
