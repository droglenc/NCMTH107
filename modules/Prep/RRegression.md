Use the preparation materials (I also suggest reviewing the preparation questions for the [Regression](LinearRegression) module) to prepare hand-written answers for the following questions. Please ask any questions on the "Questions -- Preparation Guide" on the course Team (see link on <a href="../../">the homepage</a>.)

1. What questions do you have from this reading that you would like me to address? [*Please be as specific as possible. Don't just say "everything" or "I don't understand anything." Of course, you can ask questions about the reading before class on MS Teams (see link above).*]
