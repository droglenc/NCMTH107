Use the preparation readings and videos to prepare written answers for the following questions. Please contact <a href="mailto:dogle@northland.edu">Dr. Ogle</a> if you have questions.

1. What parameter (symbol and name) controls the center of a normal distribution?
1. What parameter (symbol and name) controls the dispersion of a normal distribution?
1. What is the mean and standard deviation of a N(3,2) distribution?
1. What symbolism is used to represent the variable Q that is normally distributed with a mean of 510 and standard deviation of 70?
1. Which of these distributions -- N(0,1), N(3,2), or N (0,3) -- is centered most to the right? Most dispersed? Widest? Tallest?
1. What does the 68-95-99.7% Rule tell us?
1. The 68-95-99.7% Rule can only be used for very specific questions. What are those questions?
1. What is the difference between a "forward" and a "reverse" normal distribution question? [*Hint: what is given and what is asked for in each type of question.*]
1. What function in R is used to compute the area under the normal distribution curve?
1. This R function defaults to compute areas in a certain direction. What is that direction? What argument is used to make this function compute areas in the other direction?
1. This R function also defaults to a specific type of normal distribution calculation. What argument is use to make this function compute the other type of normal distribution question?
