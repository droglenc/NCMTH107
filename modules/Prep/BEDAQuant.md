1. Define bivariate.
1. Define response variable. What are synonyms?
1. Define explanatory variable. What are synonyms?
1. Which variable is plotted on the y-axis of a scatterplot? The x-axis?
1. What symbol is used to represent the sample correlation coefficient? The population correlation coefficient?
1. What four things are described in a bivariate EDA for two quantitative variables?
1. What words are used to describe the form of the relationship? What does a scatterplot look like for each of these words?
1. What does an outlier look like on a scatterplot?
1. What words are used to describe the association between two variables? Specifically define each of these words. What does a scatterplot look like for each of these words?
1. What does the "sign" of the correlation coefficient tell you?
1. What does the relative magnitude of the absolute value of the correlation coefficient tell you?
1. What kind of values can the correlation coefficient be?
1. When should you NOT use the correlation coefficient?
1. How do you use the correlation coefficient to make a qualitative (i.e., wordy) statement about strength for observational (or uncontrolled) studies? For experimental (or controlled) studies?
1. Explain what is meant by "correlation is not causation."
1. What questions do you have from this reading that you would like me to address? [*Please be as specific as possible. Don't just say "everything" or "I don't understand anything." Of course, you can ask questions about the reading before class on MS Teams (see link above).*]
