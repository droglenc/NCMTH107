Use the preparation materials to prepare hand-written answers for the following questions. Please ask any questions on the "Questions -- Preparation Guide" on the course Team (see link on <a href="../../">the homepage</a>.)
</div>

1. Define bivariate.
1. Define response variable. What are synonyms?
1. Define explanatory variable. What are synonyms?
1. Which variable is plotted on the y-axis of a scatterplot? The x-axis?
1. What symbol is used to represent the sample correlation coefficient? The population correlation coefficient? *You may find [this glossary](../../resources/symbols) useful.*
1. What **five** things are described in a bivariate EDA for two quantitative variables?
1. What two words may be used to describe the form of the relationship? Draw example scatterplots for for each of these words.
1. What does an outlier look like on a scatterplot?
1. What three words may be used to describe the association between two variables? Specifically define each of these words. Draw example scatterplots for for each of these words.
1. What does the "sign" of the correlation coefficient tell you?
1. What does the relative magnitude of the absolute value of the correlation coefficient tell you?
1. What values can the correlation coefficient be?
1. When should you NOT use the correlation coefficient?
1. How do you use the correlation coefficient to make a qualitative (i.e., wordy) statement about strength for observational (or uncontrolled) studies? For experimental (or controlled) studies?
1. Explain what is meant by "correlation is not causation."
1. What questions do you have from this reading that you would like me to address? [*Please be as specific as possible. Don't just say "everything" or "I don't understand anything." Of course, you can ask questions about the reading before class on MS Teams (see link above).*]
