A few days ago you should have received a welcome e-mail from me via Piazza.com that will describe how you can activate a Piazza account and access our course discussion site. You should make sure to follow those directions. If you do not still have that e-mail you can also access the page from the link on [the class homepage](../../){:target="_blank"}. Let me know if you have any questions.

You may want to [check your account settings](https://support.piazza.com/support/solutions/articles/48000574383-student-email-notification-settings){:target="_blank"} to ensure that you receive messages of discussions on Piazza as you desire (e.g., individual questions as they are asked and aswered, a daily digest of questions and answers, etc.).

Directions for asking a question on Piazza are in [this FAQ](../../resources/FAQs/Piazza). [Here are a few directions](https://support.piazza.com/support/solutions/articles/48000964938-text-editor-options-student){:target="_blank"} for how to format your post (e.g., bold-face text, add images, etc.).
