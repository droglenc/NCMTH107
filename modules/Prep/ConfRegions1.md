1. What do we hope is contained within the bounds of a confidence interval?
1. How many 95% confidence regions contain the parameter of interest? 90%? 99%?
1. How often will you make an incorrect conclusion about the value of the parameter if you use a 95% confidence region? 90%? 99%?
1. What decisions can a statistician make that will result in a narrower confidence interval? Which decision is "better"?
1. What decision can a statistician make that will result in a confidence interval that is more likely to contain the parameter of interest?
1. What does the relative width of a confidence interval tell us about how the parameter is estimated? [*i.e., how does a narrow confidence interval compare to a wide one in terms of estimating the parameter.*]
1. What are the five steps in computing a proper confidence region?
1. How is the level of confidence (C) determined from &alpha;?
1. How is the alternative hypothesis used to decide whether to construct a confidence interval, lower confidence bound, or upper confidence bound?
1. What R code do you use to find the scaling factor used to construct a confidence region?
1. What questions do you have from this reading that you would like me to address? [*Please be as specific as possible. Don't just say "everything" or "I don't understand anything." Of course, you can ask questions about the reading before class on MS Teams (see link above).*]
