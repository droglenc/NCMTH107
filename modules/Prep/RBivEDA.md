Use the preparation materials (I also suggest reviewing the preparation questions for the [Bivariate EDA - Quantitative](BEDAQuant) and [Bivariate EDA - Categorical](BEDACat) modules.) to prepare hand-written answers for the following questions. Please contact <a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3ad26a8cc37740458aaf93fe10815c9eb1%40thread.tacv2/Questions%2520-%2520Preparation%2520Guide?groupId=1c605bf3-86b9-4b57-8b0c-1753c67bf54a&tenantId=b70d8bab-80b6-4766-b5da-fcfdabdf71c7" target="_blank">Dr. Ogle</a> if you have questions.
