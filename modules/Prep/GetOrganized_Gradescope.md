A few days ago you should have received a welcome e-mail from me via Gradescope.com that will describe how you can activate a Gradescope account and access the pages where you will complete preparation check quizzes and upload you module assignments. You should make sure to follow those directions. If you do not still have that e-mail you can also access Gradescope from from the link on [the class homepage](../../){:target="_blank"} (you will need to email me for the access code (as [described here](https://www.gradescope.com/#help-center-item-student-adding-a-course){:target="_blank"})). Let me know if you have any questions.

Assignments **must** be converted to a PDF for uploading to Gradescope. If you plan to hand-write (as opposed to type) most of your answers for the semester then you should look at [the first two pages of this document](https://gradescope-static-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/help/submitting_hw_guide.pdf){:target="_blank"} that explains how to use your device to create a PDF from your hand-written papers. You should read [the last page of this document](https://gradescope-static-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/help/submitting_hw_guide.pdf){:target="_blank"} for how to upload the PDF to Gradescope. **Please take a few moments to make sure that what you turn is clear (i.e., not blurry), as large as possible, and complete.** When submitting your document you will identify on which pages you answer each question ... please do this carefully and completely (if your answer spans two pages, then make sure to select both pages).
