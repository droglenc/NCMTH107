A few days ago you should have received a welcome e-mail from me via Gradescope.com that will describe how you can activate a Gradescope account and access the pages where you will complete preparation check quizzes and upload you module assignments. You should make sure to follow those directions. If you do not still have that e-mail you can also access [the page here](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/144614/) with the access code **9GWJNZ** (as [described here](https://www.gradescope.com/#help-center-item-student-adding-a-course)). Let me know if you have any questions.

Gradescope provides a [list of FAQs for students here](https://help.gradescope.com/category/cyk4ij2dwi-student-workflow).
