Use the preparation materials to prepare hand-written answers for the following questions.

1. What is the difference between a "forward" and a "reverse" normal distribution question? [*Hint: what is given and what is asked for in each type of question.*]
1. What function in R is used to compute the area under the normal distribution curve?
1. This R function defaults to compute areas in a certain direction. What is that direction? What argument is used to make this function compute areas in the other direction?
1. This R function also defaults to a specific type of normal distribution calculation. What argument is use to make this function compute the other type of normal distribution question?
1. What questions do you have from this reading that you would like me to address? [*Please be as specific as possible. Don't just say "everything" or "I don't understand anything." Of course, you can ask questions about the reading before class on MS Teams (see link above).*]
