Use the preparation materials (I also suggest reviewing the preparation questions for the [1-Sample t-Test](1Samplet) and [2-Sample t-Test](2Samplet) modules) to prepare hand-written answers for the following questions. Please ask any questions on the "Questions -- Preparation Guide" on the course Team (see link on <a href="../../">the homepage</a>.)

1. What R function is used to perform a 2-Sample t-Test with raw data? What is the form of the first argument to this function?
1. What R function is used to perform the test for equal variances? What is the form of the first argument to this function?
1. What is the purpose of the `mu=` argument to `t.test()`?
