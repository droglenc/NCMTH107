1. What is the mean and standard deviation of a N(3,2) distribution?
1. What symbolism is used to represent the variable Q that is normally distributed with a mean of 510 and standard deviation of 70?
1. Which of these distributions -- N(0,1), N(3,2), or N (0,3) -- is centered most to the right? Most dispersed? Widest? Tallest?
1. What does the 68-95-99.7% Rule tell us?

1. What type of question is "What is the value such that 20% of individuals are larger?"?
