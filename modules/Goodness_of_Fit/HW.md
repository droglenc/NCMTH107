## Bear Habitat Use

A researcher for the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources has radio-collared several Black Bears in northern Wisconsin. At randomly selected times the researcher attempts to locate the bears and record what type of habitat they are in. For one particular bear the researcher recorded the following data: 47 observations in lowland conifer habitat, 12 in aspen, 10 in open areas, 21 in upland hardwood, and 10 in mixed upland. In addition, through GIS analysis of vegetation cover layers the researcher has determined that 34% of the available habitat is lowland conifer, 17% is in aspen, 12% is in open areas, 25% is in upland hardwoods, and 12% is in mixed upland. Use these results to determine, at the 10% level, if this bear uses these habitats in proportion to their availability.

## Ginseng Consumption by Deer

[Furedi and McGraw (2004)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228788782_White-tailed_Deer_Dispersers_or_Predators_of_American_Ginseng_Seeds) examined predation of American Ginseng (*Panax quinquefolius* L.) by Whitetail Deer (*Odocoileus virginianus* Z.). At one location and year in their study (P5, 2003) they found that 33 of 73 randomly selected reproductive ginseng plants had been consumed by deer. Use this information to determine, at the 5% significance level, if more than 33% of all plants at this location and year were consumed by deer.

## Road Rage

Road rage was defined as "an incident in which an angry or impatient motorist or passenger intentionally injures or kills another motorist, passenger, or pedestrian, or attempts or threatens to injure or kill another motorist, passenger, or pedestrian." [Rathbone and Huckabee (1999)](https://www.aaafoundation.org/sites/default/files/RoadRageFinal.pdf) reported the day of the week that 69 incidents of road rage occurred. The results of the study are in the **RoadRage.csv** ([data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/RoadRage.csv), [meta](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/RoadRage_meta.txt)) data file. Use this information to determine, at the 5% level, if incidents of road rage occur more often on certain days of the week.
