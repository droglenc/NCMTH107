## Enter Own Data

Create an R data.frame (by first creating a CSV file) that contains the first name, age (you can guess), and relationship to you (e.g., "Father", "Friend", "Partner") for four or five members of your family or close friends. In R, show the entire data frame and the structure of the data frame.

## Load Data From Webpage

Load **fire.csv** ([data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/Fire.csv), [meta](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/Fire_meta.txt)) into an R data frame called `firedf`. Show the structure of the data frame and the first three and last three rows of the data frame.
