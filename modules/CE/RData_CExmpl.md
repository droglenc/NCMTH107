## Enter Own Data

Create an R data.frame (by first creating a CSV file) that contains the following three variables for four or five members of your family or close friends: first name, age (you can guess), and relationship to you (e.g., "Father", "Friend", "Partner"). In R, show the entire data frame and the structure of the data frame.

## Load Data From Webpage

In a new script, load **fire.csv** ([data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/Fire.csv), [meta](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/Fire_meta.txt)) into an R data frame called `firedf`. Show the structure of the data frame and the first three and last three rows of the data frame.
