<strong>Note:</strong> 
<ul>
<li>Make sure to show your work when calculating the standard deviation. The method shown below is one way to show your work that produces consistent results. On assessments, not showing your work will result in a zero for the question.</li>
<li>Don't forget to arrange the values from smallest to largest when computing the median. Count the original and your arranged data to make sure you have the same number of values in both.</li>
<li>The median will be one of the observed values if n is odd, but it will be the average of two observed values if n is even.</li>
<li>If n is odd such that the median is one of the observed values, then that value is NOT included in either "half" of the data when computing the IQR. In other words, the "lower half" of the data will end right before the median and the "upper half" of the data will end right after the median. See Data Set 2 below.</li>

1. Answers will vary based on your choice of numbers. Use `iqrCalc()` to verify your answer. However, note that, with this $n$, the median is the average of the two numbers in the middle positions (i.e., 7th and 8th positions) and Q1 and Q3 will be the value in the middle position (4th) of the first (positions 1-7) and second halves (positions 8-14) of the data, respectively.

However, note that, with this $n$, the median is the average of the two numbers in the middle positions (i.e., 8th and 8th positions) and Q1 and Q3 will be the average of the values in the middle positions (4th and 5th) of the first (positions 1-8) and second halves (positions 9-16) of the data, respectively. Compare this to your calculations on the previous question.
