## Histograms II
<img src="zimgs/wild-dog-pups.jpg" alt="Wild Dog Pups" class="img-right">
[McNutt and Silk (2007)](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Pup-production%2C-sex-ratios%2C-and-survivorship-in-McNutt-Silk/8bec71d9a4a6ced4896c346dff72df143a10a651) examined pup production, sex ratios and survivorship of African wild dogs (*Lycaon pictus*). In one part of their study, they computed the sex ratio of pups in each litter by dividing the number of males in the litter by the total number of pups in the litter (thus, 1.0 means all males and 0.7 means 70% were males). The results from making this calculations on their sample of litters is shown in the histogram below.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=4, par1=TRUE}
set.seed(34329034)
df <- data.frame(lsr=rep(seq(0.1,0.91,0.09),c(1,4,19,13,18,16,9,10,3,1))+runif(94,0,0.09))
hist(~lsr,data=df,breaks=seq(0,1,0.1),xaxt="n",ylim=c(0,25),
     xlab="Litter Sex Ratio")
axis(1,seq(0,1,0.1))
abline(h=seq(1,25,1),col="lightgray",lty="dotted")
hist(~lsr,data=df,add=TRUE)
```

Use this histogram to answer these questions.

1. What is an individual in this example?
1. What is the variable in this example?
1. What type of variable is recorded?
1. How many individuals are represented in this histogram?
1. How many litters had a litter sex ratio between 0.6 and 1.0?
1. How many litters had a litter sex ratio between 0.0 and 0.1?
1. Which litter sex ratios range had the most litters observed?
1. Did most litters (the majority) have mostly male or mostly female pups?

## Math Class Grades
<img src="zimgs/math_exam.jpg" alt="Math Exam" class="img-right">
The University of North Carolina math department is noted for “giving out” low grades. To examine this, the GPA from a random sample of 22 math classes and 29 “other” university classes (from the last year) was collected and recorded in [UNCGrades.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/UNCgrades.csv). Use R to answer the following questions for these data.

1. Construct a histogram of `gpa`.
1. Compute summary statistics for `gpa`.
1. Construct histograms of `gpa` for each type of class.
1. Compute summary statistics of `gpa` for each type of class.

## Bar Chart II
<img src="http://derekogle.com/NCMTH107/modules/CE/zimgs/brownpelican.jpg" alt="Brown Pelican" class="img-right">
[King et al. (2013)](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/wildlife_damage/nwrc/publications/13pubs/king132.pdf) examined the habitat use of [Brown Pelicans (*Pelecanus
occidentalis*)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_pelican) in the Northern Gulf of Mexico. In one part of their study, they recorded the GPS location where each pelican was spotted. The bar chart below shows the percentages of those GPS locations in major habitats. Use this information to answer the questions further below. [Note that `Water`="shallow near-shore waters", `EEW`="estuarine emergent wetland", `Grassland`="shoreline grasslands", `UnShore`="unconsolidated shore", `DeepWater`="deeper offshore waters", and `Other`="all other habitats".]

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=4, par1=TRUE}
tbl <- c(0.618,0.2551,0.0392,0.0271,0.0239)
tbl <- c(tbl,1-sum(tbl))*100
names(tbl) <- c("Water","EEW","Grassland","UnShore","DeepWater","other")
barplot(tbl,xlab="Main Habitats",ylab="Percent of Recordings",col="gray90")
abline(h=seq(5,60,5),lty=2,col="gray90")
barplot(tbl,col="gray90",yaxt="n",add=TRUE)
abline(h=0)
axis(2,1:59,NA,tcl=-0.1)
axis(2,seq(0,60,5),NA,tcl=-0.2)
```

1. What is an individual in this example?
1. What type of variable is recorded?
1. What (approximate) percentage of individuals used "shallow nearshore waters"?
1. What (approximate) percentage of individuals used "estuarine emergent wetlands"?
1. What (approximate) percentate of individuals were not in the two most common habitat types?
1. What is the shape of this distribution?

## Chemical Waste Disposal
<img src="zimgs/waste-disposal.jpg" alt="Chemical Waste Disposal" class="img-right">

In June 2000, facilities management at the University of Massachusetts-Boston surveyed lab managers at the University regarding chemical waste disposal. One question that they asked the survey participants was, "Which federal agency regulates the disposal of chemical wastes: Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Transportation, or National Institutes of Health?" The individual responses for this survey are shown below by showing the first letter corresponding to each participant's category choice. Note that one participant did not answer this question and is labeled with a "U" for "unanswered." Enter these data into a CSV file, load into R, and write a brief conclusion regarding the beliefs of lab managers derived from summaries of these data.

## Popularity in Middle School
<img src="zimgs/sports_kids_1.jpg" alt="Sports Kids" class="img-right">
[Chase and Drummer (1992)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1439167) examined sports as a social status determinant for children. In their study, they surveyed 227 boys and 251 girls in grades 4, 5, and 6 from schools in Michigan to determine which criteria were most important in determining personal, female, and male popularity. In two parts of their study, students were asked what their personal goals were for school (options were "make good grades", "be popular", and "be good in sports"; `goals`) and to rank the importance that "being good in sports" is in defining popularity (1="most important"-4="least important"; `sports`). These data (and answers to several other questions) are in [PopularKids.csv](https://github.com/droglenc/NCData/raw/master/PopularKids.csv). Use these data to answer the following questions.

1. Perform a univariate EDA for `goals`.
1. Perform a univariate EDA for `sports`.
1. Perform a univariate EDA for `type` of school. Does this suggest anything about the way that students were sampled?

## Water Usage
<img src="zimgs/shower_water.jpg" alt="Shower Water" class="img-right">

Students in a senior level environmental studies class at Rice University conducted a voluntary response survey regarding water usage by their peers. They received returned surveys from a total 130 students. One question on their survey was, "On average, for how many minutes do you let the water run each time you take a shower? 0-5, 6-10, 11-15, or over 15 minutes?" The individual responses for this survey are shown below with letters corresponding to the category choices offered (e.g., "A"=0-5, "B"=6-10, and so on). Enter these data into R and  write a brief conclusion about these data.
