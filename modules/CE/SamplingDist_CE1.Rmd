## Construct Sampling Distributions
<img src="http://derekogle.com/NCMTH107/modules/CE/zimgs/calculator-1.jpg" alt="Calculations" class="img-right">
Use the very simple population of five individuals with the following values -- 12, 14, 16, 18, 20 -- to answer the following questions. [*See the hints further below for how to efficiently make these calculations using R (rather than your calculator).*]

1. Compute the center and dispersion (to three decimals) of this population. Label each result with appropriate symbols. [**See first hint below.**]
1. Identify all possible samples of n=2 from this population. [*Note that there are 10 such samples.* **See second hint below.**]
1. Compute the mean for each sample. [**See third hint below.**]
1. Compute the mean and standard deviation of all 10 sample means. [**See fourth hint below.**]
1. What should the standard deviation just calculated be called?
1. Repeat the previous four questions for samples of n=3. [*Copy-and-paste the code for n=2 but change the names to `num2` and `mns2`.*]
1. Repeat the previous question for samples of n=4. [*Copy-and-paste and use `num3` and `mns3`.*]
<br>
1. How did the means of the sample means change with increasing n?
1. How did the three means of sample means (i.e., from n=2, 3, and 4) compare to the population mean?
1. How did the three standard deviations of sample means compare to the population standard deviation?
1. How did the standard deviations of the sample means change with increasing n?

<p class="bg-info"><strong>Hint:</strong> the mean and standard deviation of a small set of numbers can be efficiently computed by entering the numbers into a vector in R (using <code>c()</code>) and submitting that vector to <code>Summarize()</code> from <code>NCStats</code>.</p>

```{r results='hide'}
popn <- c(12,14,16,18,20)      # creates population
Summarize(popn,digits=3)       # population summaries
```

<p class="bg-info"><strong>Hint:</strong> The samples from the population in <code>popn</code> may be found and stored in <code>nums2</code> as shown below.</p>

```{r results='hide'}
( nums2 <- combn(popn,2) )     # all combos of n=2 from popn
```

<p class="bg-info"><strong>Hint:</strong> The mean of each sample stored in <code>nums</code> may be computed and stored in <code>mns2</code> as shown below.</p>

```{r results='hide'}
( mns2 <- combn(popn,2,mean) ) # mean of all combos of n=2
```

<p class="bg-info"><strong>Hint:</strong> The mean and standard deviation of the means stored in <code>mns2</code> may be computed as shown below.</p>

```{r results='hide'}
Summarize(mns2,digits=2)       # summarized mean/sd of means
```
