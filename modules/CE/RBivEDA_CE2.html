<h2>North Fish Creek Discharge</h2>
<p>The instantaneous discharge (cubic feet per second) and total suspended sediments (in milligrams per liter) were recorded on 28 dates for North Fish Creek near Ashland, WI. These data are found in FishCrNWaterQuality.csv (<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/FishCrNWaterQuality.csv">data</a>, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/FishCrNWaterQuality_meta.txt">meta</a>). Describe the relationship between instantaneous discharge and total suspended sediments from these data. [<em>Think carefully about which variable should be on the y-axis.</em>]</p>

<div id="animal-longevity-and-gestation" class="section level2">
<h2>Animal Longevity and Gestation</h2>
<p>The average gestation period (i.e., length of pregnancy) of an animal is closely related to its longevity (i.e., length of its lifespan). Scientists are interested in being able to predict the average longevity (difficult to measure) from average gestation period (relatively easy to measure) for a given animal. Towards this end, data on the average gestation period and longevity (in captivity) of 40 different species of animals was recorded in animals.csv (<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/animals.csv">data</a>, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/animals_meta.txt">meta</a>). Describe the relationship between average longevity and average gestation period from these data. [<em>Think carefully about which variable should be on the y-axis.</em>]</p>

<h2>Cafe Sales</h2>
<p><img src="zimgs/cafe.jpg" alt="Cafe" class="img-right"> <a href="http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n1/depaolo.pdf">DePaolo and Robinson (2011)</a> reported on data collected from a cafe run by business students at Indiana State University. The cafe was begun because a commercial vendor had closed a similar business. The group of business students opened a replacement business and carefully monitored sales and costs over a ten-week period during the spring semester of 2010. The students recorded extensive data in CafeData.csv (<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/CafeData.csv">data</a>, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/CafeData_meta.txt">meta</a>). Load these data into R and answer the questions below. [<em>Note that these are the same data that you may have entered in a <a href="UEDAQuant2_CE2.html#cafe-sales">previous class exercise</a>.</em>]</p>
<ol>
<li>Perform a bivariate EDA for the number of coffees sold and maximum temperature. [<em>Carefully consider which one should be on the y-axis.</em>]</li>
<li>Describe the relationship between the number of cofees sold and the number of sodas sold.</li>
<li>How is the number of coffees sold related to the number of days since the cafe opened?</li>

<h2>Popularity in Middle School</h2>
<p><img src="zimgs/sports_kids_2.jpg" alt="Sports Kids" class="img-right"> <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1439167">Chase and Drummer (1992)</a> examined sports as a social status determinant for children. In their study, they surveyed 227 boys and 251 girls in grades 4, 5, and 6 from schools in Michigan to determine which criteria were most important in determining personal, female, and male popularity. In one part of their study, students were asked what their personal goals were for school (options were “make good grades”, “be popular”, and “be good in sports”; <code>goals</code>). These data (and answers to several other questions) are in <a href="https://github.com/droglenc/NCData/raw/master/PopularKids.csv">PopularKids.csv</a>. Use these data to answer the following questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>How many students in the sample were from fourth grade?</li>
<li>What percentage of the sample were students in fifth grade and said that their goal was to “be popular”?</li>
<li>What percentage of students in fourth grade said that their goal was to “be good in sports”?</li>
<li>What percentage of students in fifth grade said that their goal was to “make good grades”?</li>
<li>What percentage of all students said that their goal was to “make good grades”?</li>
<li>What percentage of students that said that their goal was to “be popular” were in sixth grade.</li>
<li>Comment on how the distribution of students into <code>goal</code> categories differs (or not) among grades.</li>
