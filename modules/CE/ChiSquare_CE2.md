## Popularity in Middle School

[Chase and Drummer (1992)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1439167) examined sports as a social status determinant for children. In their study, they surveyed 227 boys and 251 girls in grades 4, 5, and 6 from schools in Michigan to determine which criteria were most important in determining personal popularity. In one part of their study, students were asked what their personal goals were for school (options were "make good grades", "be popular", and "be good in sports"; `goals`). These data (and answers to several other questions) are in PopularKids.csv ([data](https://github.com/droglenc/NCData/raw/master/PopularKids.csv)/[meta](https://github.com/droglenc/NCData/raw/master/PopularKids_meta.txt)). Use these data to determine, at the 5% level, if student's personal goals differed among the grade levels.

Canadian pollsters polled 642 supporters of Progressive Concervative (PC) party and 159 supporters of the Liberal party in Edmonton, Alberta and asked them to rank how strongly they agreed with the statement that "Unemployment is high because trade unions have priced their members out of a job." Ratings of agreement were on a seven point scale where 1 means "strongly disagree" and 7 means "strongly agree." The results of their poll are recorded in EdmontonPoll.csv ([data](https://github.com/droglenc/NCData/raw/master/EdmontonPoll.csv)/[meta](https://github.com/droglenc/NCData/raw/master/EdmontonPoll_meta.txt)). Use these data to determine, at the 1% level, if the respondent's level of agreement differed between which party the responded supported.[^1]
