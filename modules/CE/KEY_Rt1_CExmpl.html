<h2>Recurrence of Cancer Tumors</h2>
<p>The tumor recurrence data are loaded and initially examined below. This is a very simple data frame with one variable, <code>months</code>, that contains the number of months until the tumor recurred.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>&gt; dfobj &lt;- read.csv(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/Tumors.csv&quot;)
&gt; str(dfobj)</code></pre>
<pre><code>&#39;data.frame&#39;:   42 obs. of  1 variable:
 $ months: int  19 18 17 1 21 22 54 46 25 49 ...</code></pre>
<p>The 11-steps are shown below along with the R code where appropriate.</p>
<p> </p>
<ol start="1">
<li>
α = 0.10.
</li>
<li>
H<sub>A</sub>: μ &gt; 27 and H<sub>0</sub>: μ = 27, where μ is the mean months until the tumors recurred.
</li>
</ol>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
<ul>
<li>
Remember to define the parameter.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<ol start="3">
<li>
A 1-sample t-test will be used because
</li>
<ol type="i">
<li>
one group/population is considered (this group of patients … not comparing two groups),
</li>
<li>
a quantitative variable (time to recurrence) was recorded, and
</li>
<li>
σ is UNknown (not given in the background).
</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
<ul>
<li>
These are the three characteristics that separate a 1-sample -test from other tests we will see this semester.
</li>
<li>
Please include some sort of description that shows that the characteristics are met and that you are not just listing the characteristics – in other words, include the parts in parentheses.
</li>
<li>
If σ is known it will be given in the background information. The standard deviation that will be computed from the data is s.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<ol start="4">
<li>
This study is observational as the researcher did not create groups or impose a treatment on any individuals. It is not clear or obvious whether the individuals were randomly selected or not.
</li>
</ol>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
<ul>
<li>
This appears to be part of an experiment as the patients were given a placebo. However, there are not groups created by the researchers being compared here so it is not an experiment.
</li>
<li>
Do not say that the collection was random if it is not obviously so. Ultimately, this is a problem because the p-value requires randomization. However, we will continue with the analysis in this class, but we will be aware of the potential problems that this poses.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<ol start="5">
<li>
The assumptions are met because (i) σ is UNknown and (ii) n = 42 ≥ 40.
</li>
</ol>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
<ul>
<li>
The value of n is seen in the <code>str()</code> for the data frame shown above the 11 steps.
<li>
If the n had been less than 40 then you would need to assess the shape of the histogram.
</li>
<li>
Make sure to address whether σ is known or not, even though it feels redundant with Step 3.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<p>
Calculations for the next steps are computed with <code>t.test()</code> as demonstrated below.

x̄ = $31.7.

<div class="alert alert-warning">

</li>
</ul>
</div>
<ol start="9">
<li>
Reject H<sub>0</sub> because the p-value &lt; α.
</li>
<li>
It appears that the mean time for the tumors to reoccur is greater than 27 months.
</li>
</ol>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
<ul>
<li>
Note how the conclusion is about the MEAN time to reoccur and not the time to reoccur. The test is about the summary (i.e., the MEAN) not about individuals.
</li>
<li>
Also note the use of “appears” in the summary. This language acknowledges the fact that an error (Type I or Type II) could have been made. No conclusion from a statistical hypothesis test will ever be 100% definitive.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<ol start="11">
<li>
I am 90% confident that the mean time for the tumors to reoccur is greater than $28.4.
</ol>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
<ul>
<li>
This confidence region is a lower bound, so the conclusion is that the mean is greater than the calculated amount.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Note that you will complete all 11 steps when you have the raw data (as we have done here), but you should use <code>t.test()</code> as shown here to perform all of the calculations for you.</p>
