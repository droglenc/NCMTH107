<strong>Note (for all of the EDA questions below):</strong>
<ul>
<li>
That all four items (Form, Association/Direction, Outliers, and Strength) are addressed for each question. Many students may omit outliers if no outliers exist; however, you should explicitly say “no outliers were present” (or similar) as shown below.
</li>
<li>
The form should only be considered non-linear if there is a CLEAR curve to the data. If you are wondering very hard about whether it is nonlinear or not, then it is probably linear.
</li>
<li>
Strength must be assessed even if the form is non-linear. However, if the form is non-linear then your assessment of strength will be subjective. If the form is linear then you must use the correlation coefficient (r) and the table in the reading to identify if the strength is “strong”, “moderate”, “weak”, or “no strength.”
</li>
<li>
Include a sentence in each description that describes how you assessed strength and why you did it that way. See answers below for examples.
</ul>

<div id="animal-fat-and-breast-cancer" class="section level2">
<h2>Animal Fat and Breast Cancer</h2>
<p>The relationship between age-adjusted death rate and animal fat intake is positive, linear, absent of outliers, and very strong (r=0.949; Figure on exercise). It was valid to assess strength with the correlation coefficient because of the linear form and lack of outliers.</p>

<div id="north-fish-creek-discharge" class="section level2">
<h2>North Fish Creek Discharge</h2>
<p>The relationship between total suspended solids and discharge in Fish Creek is mostly positive and mostly linear . Several outliers are apparent, with the two at a total suspended solids greater than 800 mg/L and discharge less than 600 cfs and the one with a total suspended solids of 0 mg/L and a discharge at approximately 250 cfs being most apparent (Figure 2). The strength, excluding the outliers, is moderately strong. I did not compute a correlation coefficient because of the presence of the outliers.</p>

<h2>Animal Longevity and Gestation</h2>
<p>The relationship between longevity and gestation for captive anaimls is mostly positive, nonlinear, weak, with one outlier present at an approximate longevity of 40 years and gestation period of 600 days (Figure 3).

<h2>Cafe Sales</h2>
<ol>
<li>
The relationship between number of coffees sold at the cafe and maximum daily temperature is negative, nonlinear, and moderately strong with no obvious outliers (Figure 4). I did not report the value of the correlation coefficient because of the nonlinear form.

<li>
The relationship between the number of coffees sold and the number of sodas sold at the cafe is negative, linear, and weak (r=-0.40) with no obvious outliers (Figure 5). I identified strength from the value of the correlation coefficient because of the linear form and lack of outliers.
</li>

<p>Figure 5: Scatterplot of number of coffees sold versus number of sodas sold for the college cafe.</p>
<li>
The relationship between the number of coffees sold at the cafe and the number of days since the cafe opened is primarily negative and linear, though there appears to be some cyclic trends in the data (i.e., linear decline for first 20 days, linear increase for next 15 days, linear decline for next 25 days, and then a linear increase for last 12 days; Figure 6). There is a weak outlier of a larger number of coffees sold on day 30. The strength is only moderate when compared against an overall linear trend but is somewhat strong when compared against the cyclic trend mentioned previously. The correlation coefficient was not reported due to outlier and cyclic trend present in these data.
