<h2>Math Class Grades</h2>
<p><img src="zimgs/math_exam.jpg" alt="Math Grades" class="img-right"></p>
<p>The University of North Carolina math department is noted for “giving out” low grades. To examine this, the GPA from a random sample of 22 math classes and 29 “other” university classes (from the last year) was collected and recorded in <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/UNCgrades.csv">UNCGrades.csv</a>. Use these data to answer the following questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>Separately, perform an appropriate EDA for each type of class. Refer to figures and tables as appropriate. [<em>HINT: You may construct a figure for each type of class with just one R command. One command may also be used to construct a table that contains results for each class type.</em>]</li>
<li>What two MAJOR conclusions might you make about differences in GPA between the two class types based on your observations above. [<em>HINT: Focus on EDA characteristics that you described in your answer to the previous question.</em>]</li>
</ol>

<h2>Effluent Sampling Labs</h2>
<p><img src="zimgs/effluent-samples.jpg" alt="Effluent Samples" class="img-right"></p>
<p>Municipal wastewater treatment plants are required by law to monitor their discharges into rivers and streams on a regular basis. Concern about the reliability of data from one of these self-monitoring programs led to a study in which samples of effluent were divided and sent to two labs – a State of Wisconsin lab and a private commercial lab. Each lab measured the Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) on the effluent sample sent to them. Enter these data (in stacked format with two columns labeled <code>lab</code> and <code>bod</code>) into a CSV file and read into an object named <code>df</code> in R.</p>
<pre>
State -- 6,6,8,11,18,20,28,33,34,43,71
Private -- 15,25,28,29,34,35,36,39,42,44,54
</pre>
<ol>
<li>Perform separate appropriate EDAs for each lab. Refer to figures and tables as appropriate. [<em>HINT: You may construct a figure for each lab with just one R command. One command may also be used to construct a table that contains results for each lab.</em>]</li>
<li>Comment on two MAJOR differences in the results from the two labs?</li>

<h2>Cafe Sales</h2>
<p><img src="zimgs/cafe.jpg" alt="Cafe" class="img-right"> <a href="http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n1/depaolo.pdf">DePaolo and Robinson (2011)</a> reported on data collected from a cafe run by business students at Indiana State University. The cafe was begun because a commercial vendor had closed a similar business. The group of business students opened a replacement business and carefully monitored sales and costs over a ten-week period during the spring semester of 2010. The students recorded extensive data in CafeData.csv (<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/CafeData.csv">data</a>, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/CafeData_meta.txt">meta</a>). Load these data into R, <strong>refactor</strong> the day of the week variable to be in proper order (see <a href="../../resources/FAQ/FAQs/reorder-levels.html">this FAQ</a>), and answer the questions below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Perform a univariate EDA for the number of coffees sold.</li>
<li>Examine the effect of day of the week on the distribution of number of coffees sold.</li>
<li>Perform a univariate EDA for the number of sodas sold.</li>
<li>Examine the effect of day of the week on the distribution of number of sodas sold.</li>
<li>Construct a “take home message” from your analyses.</li>
