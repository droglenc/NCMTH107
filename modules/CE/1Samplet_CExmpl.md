## Outdoor Activities
Administrators in Northlandâ€™s Outdoor Pursuits program suggested that more opportunities for organized outdoor activities should be provided if it is found that the mean time spent on organized outdoor activities (i.e., not including walking to class, going shopping, etc.) by Northland students is less than 7 hours per week. To determine if there was a need to create more opportunities for organized outdoor activities, the administrators randomly selected 45 Northland students and asked them (among other things) to identify how many hours per week they spent on organized outdoor activities since the beginning of the school year. The mean from this sample was 6.3 hours and the standard deviation was 3.2 hours. Use these results (at the 5% level) to determine if the administrators need to provide more opportunities for Northland student to engage in organized outdoor activities. Make sure to provide explicit answers with your work shown for all [11 steps of a hypothesis test](../11-steps.html).
