## Recurrence of Cancer Tumors
<img src="zimgs/cancer-cells.jpg" alt="Cancer Cells" class="img-right">
Unfortunately, certain kinds of tumors tend to recur. [Byar and Blackard (1977)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0090429577901017) examined the rate of recurrence for bladder cancer following chemotherapy. Specifically, they recorded the time of recurrence (in months) for patients that received a placebo. Assume that it was known that the population distribution was strongly right-skewed and the standard deviation was 15 months. Use the data in Tumors.csv ([data](https://github.com/droglenc/NCData/raw/master/Tumors.csv)) to determine, at the 10% level, if the mean length of tumor recurrence is greater than 27 months. Make sure to provide explicit answers with your work shown for all [11 steps of a hypothesis test](../11-steps.html).
