## Realities

1. Identify and describe three "realities" that, if they did not exist, would eliminate the need for the field of statistics (i.e., what exists in nature and life that leads to the existence of the field of statistics).

## Variability

1. Define natural and sampling variability.
1. Describe natural and sampling variability within the context of a "real-life" (or realistic) situation of interest to you. Make sure to clearly articulate the situation (e.g., *"Consider the situation where ..."*) and then specifically define the two types of variability within the context of this situation (e.g., *"Within the situation just described, natural variability would be when ... and sampling variability would be when ..."*). [This situation is completely of your choosing and can be fictitious, but should be realistic. Alternatively, think of a situation that may have arisen in one of your other classes.]
