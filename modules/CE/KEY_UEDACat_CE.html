<strong>Note:</strong>
<ul>
<li>
Note that when “performing an EDA” for categorical data you need to write a summary of what you seen in the frequency table, percentage table, or bar chart (see next note). Just making the tables or bar chart, without summarizing in words, is not an adequate EDA.
<li>
In the EDA questions below, you only need to comment about the most dominant characteristics evident in the table or bar chart. There is nothing specific to describe here as there was with quantitative data. Furthermore, don’t just repeat all of the values in the table or graph; you should be summarizing and interpreting. Keep this in mind when reviewing the answers below.
</li>
<li>
There is probably no good reason to produce both a table and bar chart when the data are simple as those shown below. I showed both in some instances below just to assure that you could see both.

<h2>Popularity in Middle School</h2>
<ol>
<li>
The goal for most kids was getting good grades, followed by being popular, and then being good in sports (Table 3; Figure 2).
</li>

<p>Figure 2: Bar chart of percentage of grade school children by their stated goal.</p>
<li>
Students feel that “being good in sports” is an important contributor to popularity as approximately 2/3rds of studens ranked this as either “most important” or “somewhat important” to being popular (Table 4; Figure 3).
</li>
<p>Table 4: Percentage of grade school children by their rank of the impiortance of being good in sports (1=most important).</p>

Students were nearly evenly distributed among rural, suburban, and urban schools. Students were likely sampled nearly equally from each type of school (Table 5; Figure 4).

<p>Most students left the water on for between 6 and 15 minutes, with students approximately evenly split between 6-10 and 11-15 minutes (Table 6). Few students left the water on for less than 5 minutes before entering the shower.</p>
