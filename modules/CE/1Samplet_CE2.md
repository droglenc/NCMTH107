## Increased Civility in Nation-States?
<img src="zimgs/scales-of-justice.jpg" alt="Scales of Justice" class="img-right">
Common wisdom has it that the world is becoming more civilized.  This would suggest that nation-states are killing fewer of their citizens (including capital punishment, deaths in civil and international wars, and all state-sponsored violence) than was once the case.  An analysis of history textbooks suggests that, in a typical year in the nineteenth century, the mean number of citizens killed by the typical nation-state was 4,104.  To examine if the world is becoming more civilized, the number of deaths from state-sponsored violence was recorded from records in the archives of [Amnesty International](http://www.amnestyusa.org/), [The International Court of Justice](http://www.icj-cij.org/homepage/), the [United Nations](http://www.un.org/en/index.html), and [The World Bank](http://www.worldbank.org/) for a random sample of 75 countries.  The mean and standard deviation for number of killings in these 75 countries was 3,292.8 and 4,814.5, respectively.  Use these results to determine, at the 5% level, if the "world is becoming more civilized."[^2]

## Sea Level Rise Rate
<img src="zimgs/sea-level-rise.jpg" alt="Sea Level Rise" class="img-right">

A group of ecologists (work of Sahagian *et al.*) examined the effects of human activities (including aquifer mining, surface water diversion and volume changes of inland lakes, desertification, wetland drainage, soil erosion in agriculture, deforestation, and dam building) on a number of water quantity measurements, including sea level rise rate, in 23 "ecosystems" in the late 20th century. The mean (standard deviation) total sea level rise rate among the 23 sampled ecosystems was 0.059 (0.135) mm/yr. Use these results, and the assumption that the sample distribution is not skewed, to determine, at the 1% significance level, if the mean sea-level increased significantly over the period of Sahagian's work. [*Hint: When identifying the hypotheses, think about what type of values the measured "sea level rise rate" would be if the sea level was indeed rising. Take special note that a "rise rate" was recorded.*]

## P-Value Calculations and Decisions II

For each situation below, (i) compute the t test statistic, (ii) compute the p-value (include a drawing to support your calculation), and (iii) make a decision about H<sub>0</sub>.

1. &alpha;=0.01, H<sub>A</sub>: &mu;<880, n=80, s=92, x&#772;=858.
1. &alpha;=0.05, H<sub>A</sub>: &mu;&ne;1500, n=40, s=790, x&#772;=1730.

## Confidence Interval Calculations II

Compute and interpret confidence regions for the two situations above. You should use the same "steps" as you did in the [confidence regions module](ConfRegions_CE2).
