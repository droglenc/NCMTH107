A few of these biologists tested to see if a certain pheromone released by injured ruffe would repel other ruffe.

In their experiment, they observed ruffe held in aquaria divided into four sections. They recorded what proportion of 24 randomly-selected ruffe caught in the St. Louis River Harbor, and then held in the aquaria, left a section when the chemical was added to that section.
