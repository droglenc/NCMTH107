<h2>Hand Calculations</h2>
<p>Use the data for the two variables (<code>VAR1</code> and <code>VAR2</code>) below to construct (by hand without R) a (i) two-way frequency table, (ii) a row-percentage table, (iii) a column-percentage table, and (iv) a total-percentage table. [<em>Hint: use <code>VAR1</code> as the columns.</em>]</p>

<h2>Fire Blight Disease</h2>
<p><img src="zimgs/fire-blight.jpg" alt="Fire Blight Disease" class="img-right"></p>
<p>Researchers conducted an experiment on 24 trees subject to a fire blight disease. Each tree was treated with one of several treatments (no action (control), removal of the affected branches, sprayed foliage with an antibiotic and removal of the affected branches). Each tree was then recorded according to one of three outcomes (tree died in the same year, tree died 2-4 years after, or tree died more than 4 years after the disease was noticed). The frequency table below show the treatment and outcome results for each of the 24 trees. Use these results to answer the questions below.</p>
<pre><code>                     outcome
treat                  Within 1 Year    2-4 Years Later    4+ Years Later
  No Action (Control)              5                  2                 0
  Removed Branches                 3                  3                 2
  Sprayed and Removed              2                  4                 3</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>What is the response variable?</li>
<li>What percentage of trees in the control treatment died within the first year after the disease was noticed?</li>
<li>What percentage of all trees were in the control treatment and died within the first year after the disease was noticed?</li>
<li>What percentage of trees in the control treatment died more than four years after the disease was noticed?</li>
<li>What percentage of trees that died 2-4 years after the disease was noticed were in the control treatment?</li>
<li>What percentage of all trees died within the first year after the disease was noticed?</li>
<li>Make an overall conclusion about how the different treatments affected survival of the trees. [<em>Hint: You may want to construct a specific type of percentage table.</em>]</li>
</ol>
