## Power Calculations (Without Context)
Compute power[^powerbeta] given the information in each situation below. 
1. &alpha;=0.05, H<sub>0</sub>:&mu;=50, H<sub>A</sub>:&mu;<50, &sigma;=20, n=50, and &mu;<sub>A</sub>=45.
1. &alpha;=0.10, H<sub>0</sub>:&mu;=10, H<sub>A</sub>:&mu;>10, &sigma;=5, n=25, and &mu;<sub>A</sub>=12.
1. &alpha;=0.01, H<sub>0</sub>:&mu;=75, H<sub>A</sub>:&mu;>75, &sigma;=15, n=30, and &mu;<sub>A</sub>=82.

## Conceptual Questions

1. What is &beta; if power=0.875?
1. For a constant sample size, &sigma;, and difference between the hypothesized and actual means, what happens to power, if &alpha; is INcreased?
1. For a constant &alpha;, &sigma;, and difference between the hypothesized and actual means, what happens to power, if the sample size INcreases?
1. For a constant &alpha;, &sigma;, and sample size, what happens to power if the difference between the hypothesized and actual means increases?

1. For a constant &alpha;, &sigma;, and sample size, what happens to &beta; if the difference between the hypothesized and actual means INcreases?
1. Describe a real-life situation where you think that making a Type II error would be much more "costly" than making a Type I error. Completely describe the situation at hand and what Type I and a Type II errors mean in terms of the situation you describe.

[^powerbeta]: Power and &beta; sum to 1 such that Power=1-&beta; and &beta;=1-power.
