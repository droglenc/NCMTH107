## Sales Transactions
Past sales data for a company indicates that the average sale was $120 per transaction with a standard deviation of $15. The company provided enhanced training for the new sales force and recorded the amount for 48 transactions. The results are shown below.

<pre><code>
 n    mean     sd     min     Q1  median     Q3    max
48  130.26   17.6   12.80  67.45  107.10  180.5  317.2 </code></pre>

Did, at the 10% level, the training result in an increase in the mean transaction amount?  Make sure to provide explicit answers with your work shown for all [11 steps of a hypothesis test](../11-steps.html).
