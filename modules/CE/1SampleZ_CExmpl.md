## Sales Transactions
<img src="zimgs/checkout2.jpg" alt="Checking out" class="img-right">
Past sales data for a company indicates that the average sale was $120 per transaction with a standard deviation of $15.  The company provided enhanced training for the new sales force and recorded the amount for 48 transactions.  The results are shown below.

<pre><code>
 n    mean     sd     min     Q1  median     Q3    max
48  130.26   17.6   12.80  67.45  107.10  180.5  317.2 </code></pre>

Did, at the 10% level, the training result in an increase in the mean transaction amount?  Make sure to provide explicit answers with your work shown for all [11 steps of a hypothesis test](../11-steps.html).

## Recurrence of Cancer Tumors
<img src="zimgs/cancer-cells.jpg" alt="Cancer Cells" class="img-right">
Unfortunately, certain kinds of tumors tend to recur.  [Byar and Blackard (1977)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0090429577901017) examined the rate of recurrence for bladder cancer following chemotherapy.  Specifically, they recorded the time of recurrence (in months) for patients that received a placebo.  Assume that it was known that the population distribution was strongly right-skewed and the standard deviation was 15 months.  Use the data in [Tumors.csv](https://github.com/droglenc/NCData/raw/master/Tumors.csv) to determine, at the 10% level, if the mean length of tumor recurrence is greater than 27 months.  Make sure to provide explicit answers with your work shown for all [11 steps of a hypothesis test](../11-steps.html).
