<strong>Note:</strong>
<ul>
<li>
Make sure to define your parameters in Step 2.
</li>
<li>
Make sure to describe your evidence in Step 3 for why you are performing a 2-sample t-test. It is not adequate to simply say “because there is a quantitative response variable, two groups are being tested, and the groups are independent.” At least say what the response variable is and what the two groups are and provide some discussion for why you think the groups are independent.
</li>
<li>
Also make sure to describe your evidence in Step 5 for why the assumptions are met. It is not adequate to simply say “n<sub>1</sub>+n<sub>2</sub>≥40” or “n<sub>1</sub>+n<sub>2</sub>≥15 and the sample distributions are not strongly skewed.” You should state the actual n<sub>1</sub>+n<sub>2</sub> value and direct the reader to how you know the distributions are not strongly skewed (i.e., likely to histograms).
</li>
<li>
In hand calculations, note that the test statistic (t in Step 7) is NOT the critical value (i.e., t<sup>*</sup>) needed for the confidence region (in Step 11).
</li>
<li>
Note the use of “mean” in both Steps 10 and 11. The test is for mean number of plants that germinated, not number of plants that germinated.
</li>
<li>
You values may differ slightly from mine as I calculate everything in R that holds many decimal places on intermediate values.

H<sub>A</sub>: μ<sub>b</sub>-μ<sub>h</sub> &gt; 0 and H<sub>0</sub>: μ<sub>b</sub>-μ<sub>h</sub> = 0, where μ is the mean number of germinated plants, b is the bought compost, and h is the homemade compost.
</li>
<li>
2-sample t-test because (i) two groups/populations are considered (bought and homemade compost), (ii) a quantitative variable (number germinated) was recorded, and (iii) individuals in the groups are independent (there is no known connection between all pairs of containers with bought and homemade compost).
</li>
<li>
An experimental study was conducted without obvious random selection of the containers wtih soil, but with randomization allocation (placement of containers in the greenhouse).
</li>
<li>
The assumptions are met because (i) the samples are independent (as described above), (ii) n<sub>b</sub>+n<sub>h</sub> = 18+10 = 28 &gt; 15 and the two sample distributions (shown on the handout) are not obviously strongly skewed, and (iii) the variances appear to be equal (Levene’s p-value = 0.2414 &gt; α).

p-value&lt;0.00005 (more specifically 1.492e-09).
</li>
<li>
Reject H<sub>0</sub> because the p-value &lt; α.
</li>
<li>
It appears that the the mean number of plants that germinate is significantly lower for the homemade than the bought compost. Thus, the homemade compost “performs” worse than the store bought compost and may lead to increased costs for the greenhouse.
</li>
<li>
I am 90% confident that the mean number of plants that germinated with the bought compost is at least 11.7 plants greater than the mean number of plants that germinated with the homemade compost.

2-sample t-test because (i) two groups/populations are considered (Bosnia and Persian Gulf), (ii) a quantitative variable (delivery time) was recorded, and (iii) the indivduals in the groups are independent (there is no known connection between all deliveries to the two wars).

The mean delivery time was significantly lower in Bosnia than in the Persian Gulf War. Thus, the new “just-in-time” mentality for deliveries appears to have resulted in quicker delivery times.

</li>
<li>
A two-sample t-test is required because a quantitative variable (commitment level score) was measured on two groups (“did evacuate” and “did not evacuate”) that were <strong>IN</strong>dependent (no connection between individuals that did and those that did not evacuate their pets).
</li>
<li>
The data appear to be part of a voluntary response observational study without clear randomization.
</li>
<li>
The assumptions are met because the two groups appear to be independent, the sample size (n<sub>did</sub>+n<sub>didnot</sub>=241) is &gt;40 and we were told that the p-value for Levene’s test of the homogeneity of variance test is “large” (i.e., &gt;0.01) so that it appears that the variances between groups are equal. Therefore, the test statistic computed below should reasonably follow a t-distribution with n<sub>did</sub>+n<sub>didnot</sub>-2=239 df.
</li>
<li>
The statistic is x̄<sub>did</sub>-x̄<sub>didnot</sub> = 7.694-6.640 = 1.054. The pooled sample variance is, <span class="math display">\[s_{p}^{2}=\frac{(116-1)3.410^{2}+(125-1)3.102^{2}}{116+125-2} = 10.58749 \]</span> The standard error of the statistic is, <span class="math display">\[ SE_{\bar{x}_{did}-\bar{x}_{didnot}}=\sqrt{10.58749\left(\frac{1}{116}+\frac{1}{125} \right)} = 0.4194894  \]</span>

The average commitment to animals was significantly greater for those people that did evacuate their pets as compared to those people that did not evacuate their pets.

<li>
The 99% lower bound is 1.054-2.342051*0.419 = 0.073. One is 99% confident that the mean level of commitment for those that evacuated their pets is at least 0.073 greater than those that did not evacuate their pets.

</li>
<li>
A two-sample t-test is required because quantitative variable (methyl mercury level) was measured on two groups (“impacted” and “reference” sites) that were <strong>IN</strong>dependent (no connection between sites at the two locations).
</li>
<li>
The data appear to be part of an observational study without clear randomization.
</li>
<li>
The assumptions are not quite met but we will continue anyway. The two groups appear to be independent. The variances appear to be equal because the p-value from the Levene’s test is “large” (i.e., p=0.3595&gt;0.05; Table 2). The sample size (n<sub>i</sub>+n<sub>r</sub>=13) is not &gt;15 and there is not enough data to make useful histograms. Therefore, the test statistic computed below may not follow a t-distribution with n<sub>i</sub>+n<sub>r</sub>-2=11 df.
