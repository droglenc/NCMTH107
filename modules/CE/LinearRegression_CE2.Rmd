Kirsten Gorman examined various aspects of three species of penguins (Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo) on Palmer Island, Antarctica.^[PengData] In one part of her research she examined the relationship between flipper length (mm) and body mass (g) with the hope of being able to predice body mass from flipper length. The results of her analysis are shown below.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=7/3}
d <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/penguins/master/data/penguins_lter.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(species_short=stringr::word(species,1))
ggplot(data=d,mapping=aes(x=flipper_length_mm,y=body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(pch=21,color="black",fill="lightgrey",size=2) +
  geom_smooth(method="lm",se=FALSE,color="black",size=1) +
  ggpubr::stat_regline_equation(aes(label=..eq.label..),
                                label.x.npc=0,label.y.npc=1) +
  ggpubr::stat_regline_equation(aes(label=..rr.label..),
                                label.x.npc=0,label.y.npc=0.90) +
  labs(x="Flipper Length (mm)",y="Body Mass (g)") +
  theme_NCStats() +
  theme(aspect.ratio=1,plot.title=element_text(size=12)) +
  facet_wrap(~species_short,nrow=1)
```

Use the results for **CHINSTRAP** penguins to answer the questions below.

1. In terms of the variables of this problem, what is the equation of the best-fit line?
1. In terms of the variables of this problem, INTERPRET the value of the slope?
1. In terms of the variables of this problem, INTERPRET the value of the y-intercept?
1. What is the predicted body mass for a flipper length of 200 mm?
1. What is the predicted body mass for a flipper length of 160 mm??
1. What is the residual if the body mass is 3000 g and the flipper length is 190 mm?
1. What is the correlation coefficient between flipper length and body mass?
1. What proportion of the variability in body mass is explained by knowing the flipper length?
1. How much would you expect the body mass to change if the flipper length decreased by 25 mm?
1. What aspect of this regression analysis concerns you (i.e., consider the regression assumptions)?
