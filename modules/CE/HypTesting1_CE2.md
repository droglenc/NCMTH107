# Identifying Hypotheses
For each research hypothesis or statement below, construct the null and alternative hypotheses (use their respective symbols) and explicitly define the parameter in the hypotheses.

1. A researcher is investigating the mean growth of a certain cactus under a variety of environmental conditions. Under the current environmental conditions, he hypothesizes that mean growth is no more than 4 cm.
1. Machowiak *et al.* (1992) critically examined the belief that the mean body temperature differed from 98.6<sup>o</sup>F by measuring the body temperatures of 93 healthy humans.
1. A study by Cheshire *et al.* (1994) reported on six patients with chronic myofascial pain syndrome. The authors were examining the hypothesis that the mean pain length was greater than 2.5 years.

I urge you to follow these steps when answering all p-value-related questions:
<ol type="a">
  <li>Identify H<sub>0</sub> and H<sub>A</sub>. If the question has a context then the parameter should be stated within that context.</li>
  <li>Define the p-value specific to the situation.</li>
  <li>Draw the null distribution.</li>
  <li>Compute the p-value.</li>
  <li>Make a decision about H<sub>0</sub>. If the question has a context then the conclusion should be stated within that context.</li>
</ol>
A reminder to use these steps will <strong>NOT</strong> be provided on future quizzes, but you should get in the habit of following them. See <a href="../Explanations/Calc_pvalue_Z.html">here</a> for a demonstration of the steps.

# Computing P-Values (without context)
Compute the p-value (see the steps suggested above) For each situation below.

1. H<sub>A</sub>: &mu;>880, &sigma;=90, n=80, x&#772;=918, &alpha;=0.01.
1. H<sub>A</sub>: &mu;&#8800;800, &sigma;=60, n=25, x&#772;=824, &alpha;=0.01.
1. &alpha;=0.05, H<sub>A</sub>: &mu;<80, n=30, &sigma;=20, x&#772;=73.
1. &alpha;=0.05, H<sub>A</sub>: &mu;&#8800;1500, n=40, &sigma;=800, x&#772;=1370.
1. &alpha;=0.10, H<sub>A</sub>: &mu;>10, n=25, &sigma;=5, x&#772;=12.1.
1. &alpha;=0.05, H<sub>A</sub>: &mu;<50, n=50, &sigma;=20, x&#772;=43.8.
1. &alpha;=0.01, H<sub>A</sub>: &mu;&#8800;100, n=100, &sigma;=15, x&#772;=98.

# Conceptual Question
Describe why we must formally go through the steps of a hypothesis test to conclude that &mu;>11 when we observe x&#772;=12.1.
