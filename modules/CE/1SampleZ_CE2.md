## Credit Card Limits
<img src="zimgs/credit-card.jpg" alt="Credit Cards" class="img-right">

Credit card companies use a regression model (includes such factors as income, employment, credit history) to determine the credit worthiness of a prospective card holder. In the past, the companies used a threshold (cutoff) limit of 630 to receive a card. It is also assumed that the standard deviation of all potential credit card holders is 5. Recent information suggests that delinquencies have been increasing and it is hypothesized that credit card companies will raise the "cutoff score" in response. Examine the following results concerning "cutoff scores" from 44 credit card issuers to determine, at the 10% level, if there is evidence that the "cutoff score" has been increased significantly from 630.

Variable   Mean  Median StDev  Min  Max    Q1     Q3
CCards   636.86  636.50  4.42  629  647  633.25 640.00
