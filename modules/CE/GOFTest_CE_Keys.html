<li>
Goodness-of-fit test because (i) one group or population (students) were sampled and (ii) the response variable (water choice) is categorial.
</li>
<li>
This is quasi-experimental as the students were given a choice of only certain waters. The students were not obviously randomly selected (and were likely part of a voluntary response survey).
</li>
<li>
All cells in the expected frequency table (Table 1) were greater than 5; the assumptions for a goodness-of-fit test have been met.

It appears that there is a preference for water type by the students. Further analysis (Table 4) suggests that the students preferred the tap water.

This is observational as habitat use by the turkeys was simply recorded. The turkey observations were not randomly selected (the researchers likely chose days to sample).

A goodness-of-fit test is required because a single categorical variable (habitat use) from a single group or population (this bear) was measured and the proportions are being compared to a theoretical distribution in the null hypothesis.

This is an observational study with randomly selected times for observation.

The expected number of observations in each habitat is in proportion to the GIS analysis of habitat availability. Thus, the expected number in each habitat is shown in Table 13 (along with the observed frequencies). Note that these percentages did not need to be adjusted to the number of observations because 100 observations were made. The test statistic computed below should reasonably follow a chi-square distribution because all of the expected values are greater than five.
