<strong>Note:</strong>
<ul>
<li>
Make sure to describe your evidence in Step 3 for why you are performing a 1-sample t-test. It is not adequate to simply say “because there is a quantitative response variable, only one group is being tested, and sigma is unknown.” At least say what the response variable is and what the one groups is.
</li>
<li>
Also make sure to describe your evidence in Step 5 for why the assumptions are met. It is not adequate to simply say “n≥40” or “n≥15 and the sample distribution is not strongly skewed.” You should state the actual n and direct the reader to how you know the distribution is not strongly skewed (i.e., likely a histogram).
</li>
<li>
In hand calculations, note that the test statistic (t in Step 7) is NOT the critical value (i.e., t<sup><em></sup>) needed for the confidence region (in Step 11). The t you calculate in Step 7 has nothing to do with the t<sup></em></sup> you will find in Step 11.
</li>
<li>
When computing the t in Step 7, the numerator is always x̄ minus the specific value in H<sub>0</sub> from Step 2.
</li>
<li>
The p-value in this example is shaded to the left of the t from Step 7 and the result from <code>distrib()</code> is multiplied by 2 because the H<sub>A</sub> is a not equals. If the t had been positive you would have shaded to the right and then multiplied by 2. When the H<sub>A</sub> is a not equals you always shaded into the tail nearest t and multiply the <code>distrib()</code> result by 2.
</li>
<li>
In Steps 10 and 11 don’t say μ. Rather replace it with μ means. See how those steps below say “mean CFU for ALL 100 ml of water” rather than just μ.
</li>
<li>
Also in Step 10 you can be more specific then saying that the mean CFL differs from 178. Because the x̄ is less than what was hypothesized you can say that the mean CFL differs from 178 by being less than 178. So, even though you strictly only tested for a difference in this not equal situation, you can be more specific with your statement in Step 10.
</li>
<li>
Your values may differ slightly from mine as I calculate everything in R that holds many decimal places on intermediate values.
