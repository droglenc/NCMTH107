<h2>Equation of the Line I</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Dishwasher Example</strong>
<ol>
<li>response - Height of suds (mm)</li>
<li>explanatory - Amount of soap (g)</li>
<li>slope is 12.4</li>
<li>intercept is -20.2</li>
<li>For each additional gram of soap, the height of suds increases by 12.4 mm, on average.</li>
<li>For 0 grams of soap, the height of suds is -20.2 mm, on average. [<em>This is an extrapolation.</em>]</li>
<li>Ask to predict height of suds for an amount of soap between 3.5 and 8.0 grams. Example … “What is the predicted height of suds for 5 g of soap?” Answer … -20.2+12.4*5=41.8 mm.</li>
<li>Ask to predict height of suds for an amount of soap not between 3.5 and 8.0 grams. Example … “What is the predicted height of suds for 10 g of soap?”</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>Livestock Food Example</strong>
<ol>
<li>response - Costs</li>
<li>explanatory - Livestock food mix in tons</li>
<li>Slope is 190.</li>
<li>Intercept is 12075</li>
<li>For each additional ton of the food mix, the cost increases by $190, on average.</li>
<li>For 0 tons of the food mix, the costs are $12075, on average. [<em>This may be considered as “start-up” costs.</em>]</li>
<li>Ask to predict costs for food mix amounts between 36.5 and 42 tons. Example … “What is the cost to make 40 tons of the mix?” Answer … 190*40+12075 = $19675.</li>
<li>Ask to predict costs for food mix amounts not between 36.5 and 42 tons. Example … “What is the cost to make 70 tons of the mix?”</li>

<strong>Note:</strong> In the applied questions below …
<ul>
<li>
The words “response”, “explanatory”, “y”, and “x” are not used at all. These words should be replaced with the actual variable names used in the problem.
</li>
<li>
The x-axis (explanatory) variable is <strong>increased</strong> by 1 unit when describing the slope. If the slope is positive then the y-axis (response) variable increases by the slope amount for each 1 unit increase of the explanatory variable. If the slope is negative then the y-axis (response) variable decreases by the slope amount (with the negative sign removed) for each 1 unit increase of the explanatory variable.
</li>
<li>
Interpret the y-intercept value even if it does not make sense, which will happen often as the y-intercept is often an extreme extrapolation.
</li>
<li>
When computing the residual, make sure to do the observed y-axis (response) value minus the predicted y-axis (response) value. About half the time this will result in a negative value. That is okay, it just means that the observed value was less than the predicted value (i.e., the observed point was below the best-fit line).
</li>
<li>
The words “proportion of variability explained” <strong>always</strong> imply using r<sup>2</sup> as the answer.
</li>
<li>
The correlation coefficient is always the value of r. If you compute r by taking the square root of r<sup>2</sup> then remember to put a negative sign on it if the slope (i.e., direction or association) is negative (your calculator will always return a positive value).
</li>
<li>
When assessing whether anything “concerns” you about the regression then you should address whether the form looks linear and if there is homoscedasticty. Non-linear forms will look obviously curved, heteroscedastic forms will look like a funnel (usually from narrow on the left to wider on the right). If you do not see a curve or a funnel, then explicitly say that you do not have any concerns about the lack of linearity or homoscedasticity.

<div id="beach-sand" class="section level2">
<h2>Beach Sand</h2>
<ol>
<li>The equation of the best-fit line is SAND = 0.16+0.053*ANGLE</li>
<li>For each 1 degree increase in beach angle, the median sand diameter increases by 0.053 mm, on average.</li>
<li>If there is 0 beach angle, then the median sand diameter is 0.16 mm, on average.</li>
<li>This prediction should not be computed, because 15 degrees of beach angle is outside of the domain of the data used to define the relationship (i.e., this is an extrapolation).</li>
<li>The predicted median sand diameter for a beach angle of 4 degrees is 0.372 mm.</li>
<li>The residual for an observed median sand diameter of 0.2 mm and beach angle of 5 degrees is -0.225 mm.</li>
<li>The correlation coefficient between median sand diameter and beach angle is -0.954.</li>
<li>The proportion of variability in median sand diameter that is explained by knowing the angle of the beach is 0.910.</li>
<li>I would expect the median sand diameter to increase by four slopes or 0.212 mm, on average, if the beach angle increased by 4 degrees.</li>
<li>The relationship between median sand diameter and beach angle appears to be nonlinear.</li>

<div id="everest-temperatures" class="section level2">
<h2>Everest Temperatures</h2>
<ol>
<li>The equation of the best-fit line is AIRTEMP = 29.79+-0.0059*ALTLAPSERATE</li>
<li>If the altitude lapse rate is 0, then the mean air temperature is 29.79<sup>o</sup>C, on average.</li>
<li>For each 1 degree increase in altitude lapse rate, the mean air temperature decreases by 0.0059<sup>o</sup>C, on average.</li>
<li>The predicted mean air temperature for an altitude lapse rate of 4000 <sup>o</sup>C/km is 6.19<sup>o</sup>C.</li>
<li>The residual for an observed mean air temperature of 0<sup>o</sup>C and altitude lapse rate of 3500<sup>o</sup>C/km is -9.14<sup>o</sup>C.</li>
<li>The correlation coefficient between mean air temperature and altitude lapse rate is 0.961.</li>
<li>I would expect the mean air temperature to decrease by 1000 slopes or 5.900 mm, on average, if the altitude lapse rate increased by 1000<sup>o</sup>C/km.</li>
<li>This prediction should not be computed, because 1000<sup>o</sup>C/km of altitude lapse rate is outside of the domain of the data used to define the relationship (i.e., this is an extrapolation).</li>
<li>The proportion of variability in mean air temperature that is explained by knowing the altitude lapse rate is 0.923.</li>
<li>I have no concerns as the relationship between mean air temperature and altitude lapse rate appears to be linear (no evident curve) and homoscedastic (no evident funnel).</li>
