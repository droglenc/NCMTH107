## Diet and Weight Gain
<img src="zimgs/taking-weight.jpg" alt="Cancer Cells" class="img-right">
Suppose that 1500 women followed a popular diet for a month.  A random sample of 35 of these women was taken and the results for weight gained are shown below.

<pre><code>
 n   mean    sd    min    Q1  median     Q3    max
35    6.7   7.3   -2.8   0.7     4.2   10.5   17.2 </code></pre>

Assuming that the standard deviation for all 1500 women was 7.1, test, at the 5% level, that the average weight gain per woman for the month was over 5 pounds.

## Cactus Growth
<img src="zimgs/cactus.jpg" alt="Cactus" class="img-right">

A researcher is investigating the growth of a certain cactus under a variety of environmental conditions. He knows from previous research that the growth of this particular type of cactus is approximately normally distributed with a standard deviation of 1.40 cm. Under the current environmental conditions that he is investigating, however, he does not know the mean. He does hypothesize that it is no more than 4 cm. To test this hypothesis he used a preliminary sample of 10 randomly-selected cacti. He found the sample mean for these cacti to be 3.26 cm. Use this information to test his hypothesis with &alpha;=0.05.

## Elk Density in Banff
<img src="zimgs/elk-inBanff.jpg" alt="Elk in Banff" class="img-right">

[Hebblewhite (2000)](http://www.carnivoreconservation.org/files/thesis/hebblewhite_2000_msc.pdf) recorded the density (number per square km) of Elk (*Cervus elaphus*) in Banff National Park, Alberta, CA from 1986 to 2000. The raw data from his study are shown below. Further assume that it is known from previous studies that the standard deviation of density estimates for all years is 2 elk per square kilometer and the distribution is approximately normal. Use this information to construct and fully interpret a test, at the 10% significance level, of whether the mean density of elk is greater than 8 per square km.

<pre>
 5.20, 7.79, 6.46, 8.60, 8.97,8.65, 9.60, 9.09,
12.42,10.70,11.59,10.68,10.61,9.04,10.89
