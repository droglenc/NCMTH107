## Examining Single Variables

1. Examine the stand type (i.e., `sttype`) variable.
1. Examine the litter depth (i.e., `litdep`) variable.

1. Isolate just the `deciduous` stand types.
1. Isolate the stands with a litter depth less than 2 cm.
1. Isolate the stand types that are either coniferous or mixed-coniferous.
1. Isolate stands that were coniferous (not including mixed-coniferous) and had a litter depth greater than 2 cm.
1. Isolate all stands that had a litter depth between 1 and 1.5 cm.
