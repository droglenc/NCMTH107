In the remaining questions, the “trick” to making the computation is to determine if the question is restricted to only a portion of the data. If the question is restricted to one of the levels that corresponds to a row then compute a row percentage (i.e., divide the raw frequency by the total of its row). If the question is restricted to one of the levels that corresponds to a column then compute a column percentage (i.e., divide the raw frequency by the total of its column). If the question does not restrict to a level in either a row or column, then compute a table or total percentage (i.e., divide the raw frequency by the total number of individuals in the table.
