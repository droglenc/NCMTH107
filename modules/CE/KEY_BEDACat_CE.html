In the remaining questions, the “trick” to making the computation is to determine if the question is restricted to only a portion of the data. If the question is restricted to one of the levels that corresponds to a row then compute a row percentage (i.e., divide the raw frequency by the total of its row). If the question is restricted to one of the levels that corresponds to a column then compute a column percentage (i.e., divide the raw frequency by the total of its column). If the question does not restrict to a level in either a row or column, then compute a table or total percentage (i.e., divide the raw frequency by the total number of individuals in the table.

<li>
Generally speaking, percentages should be rounded to one decimal place (as illustrated below).

The percentage of all trees in the control treatment that were dead within the first year is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{5}{7}\times 100\)</span> = <strong>71.4%</strong>.

The percentage of ALL trees that were in the control treatment AND were dead within the first year is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{5}{24}\times 100\)</span> = <strong>20.8%</strong>.

The percentage of the trees in the control treatment that died after four years is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{0}{7}\times 100\)</span> = <strong>0.0%</strong>.

The percentage of the trees that died after 2-4 years that were in the control treatment is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{2}{9}\times 100\)</span> = <strong>22.2%</strong>.

Trees died much earlier when no action was taken (Table 1). Spraying and removing branches was slightly more effective (i.e., trees lived longer) than just removing branches.
