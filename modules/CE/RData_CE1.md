## Loading Your Own Data
Record three variables (**at least one quantitative and one categorical**) about at least five individuals of interest to you (e.g., people you know, pets, animals, cities, countries, music, sports, etc.). Enter these data into a CSV file, load the data into a data.frame in R, and show the entire data.frame (i.e., all variables and all individuals).
