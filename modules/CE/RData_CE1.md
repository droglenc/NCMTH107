## Data from Webpage
Download the BrainHead.csv ([file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/BrainHead.csv){:target="_blank"}/[meta](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/BrainHead_meta.txt){:target="_blank"}) data file from the class webpage into your "R Directory" and load the data into a data.frame in R. Display the `str()`ucture of the data.frame to answer the following questions

1. How many variables are in the data.frame.
1. What are the names of the variables in the data.frame.
1. How many individuals are in the data.frame.

<br>

## Own Data
Record three variables (**at least one quantitative and one categorical**) about at least five individuals of interest to you (e.g., people you know, pets, animals, cities, countries, music, sports, etc.). Enter these data into a CSV file, load the data into a data.frame in R, and show the entire data.frame (i.e., all variables and all individuals). [*Hint: Your answer can simply refer me to your "R Code and Results" subsection.*]

## Stacked Data
The following data are test scores for students in two sections of class.

<pre>
Early   68  78  64  55  82  63  59
Late    87  92  73  83  91
</pre>

Enter these data into a CSV file in stacked format (described in [Section 23.1.2](https://derekogle.com/Book107/RData.html#read-csv-file-into-rstudio) or [this FAQ](http://derekogle.com/NCMTH107/resources/FAQs/stacked-data.html)), load the data into an object called `test` in R, and show the entire data frame. [*Hint: Your answer can simply refer me to your "R Code and Results" subsection.*]
