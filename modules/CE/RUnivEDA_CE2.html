<div id="dow-jones" class="section level2">
<h2>Dow Jones</h2>
<p><img src="zimgs/DowJones.jpg" alt="Dow Jones" class="img-right"> The Dow Jones Travel Index tracks the cost of hotel and car-rental rates in 20 major cities. For its May 7, 1996, survey the rates below were given for the 20 cities. Thoroughly describe the distribution of these data. [<em>Note: You can use fewer than the ideal number of bars on your histogram because the sample size is so small in this situation.</em>]</p>

<div id="curbside-recycling" class="section level2">
<h2>Curbside Recycling</h2>
<p><img src="zimgs/curbside_recycling.jpg" alt="Curbside Recycling" class="img-right"> A neighborhood in Honolulu conducted a survey to determine if residents participated in the curbside recycling program. One question on their survey was “How much has curbside recycling reduced your regular refuse? 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%, or ‘too early to tell’?” The individual responses for the returned surveys are shown below with letters corresponding to the category choices offered (e.g., “A”=0%, “B”=25%, and so on). Construct a univariate EDA with these data.</p>

<div id="zoo-animal-types" class="section level2">
<h2>Zoo Animal Types</h2>
<p><img src="zimgs/zoo2.jpg" alt="Zoo" class="img-right"> The data in <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/Zoo1.csv">Zoo1.csv</a> contains a list of animals found in several different zoos. In addition, each animal was classified into broad “type” categories (“mammal”, “bird”, and “amph/rep”). Perform a univariate EDA for the type of animals in the zoos.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="water-usage" class="section level2">
<h2>Water Usage</h2>
<p><img src="zimgs/shower_water.jpg" alt="Shower Water" class="img-right"> Students in a senior level environmental studies class at Rice University conducted a voluntary response survey regarding water usage by their peers. They received returned surveys from a total 130 students. One question on their survey was, “On average, for how many minutes do you let the water run each time you take a shower? 0-5, 6-10, 11-15, or over 15 minutes?” The individual responses for this survey are shown below with letters corresponding to the category choices offered (e.g., “A”=0-5, “B”=6-10, and so on). Enter these data into R and write a brief conclusion about these data.</p>

<div id="chemical-waste-disposal" class="section level2">
<h2>Chemical Waste Disposal</h2>
<p><img src="zimgs/waste-disposal.jpg" alt="Chemical Waste Disposal" class="img-right"> In June 2000, facilities management at the University of Massachusetts-Boston surveyed lab managers at the University regarding chemical waste disposal. One question that they asked the survey participants was, “Which federal agency regulates the disposal of chemical wastes: Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Transportation, or National Institutes of Health?” The individual responses for this survey are shown below by showing the first letter corresponding to each participant’s category choice. Note that one participant did not answer this question and is labeled with a “U” for “unanswered.” Enter these data into a CSV file, load into R, and write a brief conclusion regarding the beliefs of lab managers derived from summaries of these data.</p>

<div id="popularity-in-middle-school" class="section level2">
<h2>Popularity in Middle School</h2>
<p><img src="zimgs/sports_kids_1.jpg" alt="Sports Kids" class="img-right"> <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1439167">Chase and Drummer (1992)</a> examined sports as a social status determinant for children. In their study, they surveyed 227 boys and 251 girls in grades 4, 5, and 6 from schools in Michigan to determine which criteria were most important in determining personal, female, and male popularity. In two parts of their study, students were asked what their personal goals were for school (options were “make good grades”, “be popular”, and “be good in sports”; <code>goals</code>) and to rank the importance that “being good in sports” is in defining popularity (1=“most important”-4=“least important”; <code>sports</code>). These data (and answers to several other questions) are in <a href="https://github.com/droglenc/NCData/raw/master/PopularKids.csv">PopularKids.csv</a>. Use these data to answer the following questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>Perform a univariate EDA for <code>goals</code>.</li>
<li>Perform a univariate EDA for <code>sports</code>.</li>
<li>Perform a univariate EDA for <code>type</code> of school. Does this suggest anything about the way that students were sampled?</li>
</ol>
