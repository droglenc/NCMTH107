## Study Types II
For each question below, identify whether it represents an observational or experimental study. Explain your reasoning.

1. [Hagerman *et al.* (2000)](http://biomedgerontology.oxfordjournals.org/content/55/7/B336.abstract) found that the leg muscles of men aged 60 to 75 were 50% to 80% stronger after they participated in a 16‐week, high‐intensity resistance‐training program twice a week. 
1. [Muscat *et al.* (2000)]() examined the relationship between cell phone usage and the risk of brain cancer.  They obtained a group of 469 people who had brain cancer and matched each cancer patient with a person of the same age, sex, and race who did not have brain cancer.  They then asked all individuals about their frequency of cell phone use.  Their final conclusion was that "*[o]ur data suggest that the use of hand-held cellular phones is not associated with risk of brain cancer.*"
1. A recent study in Europe looked at a large group of women of childbearing age.  The researchers asked each woman how much alcohol they had consumed over the past 12 months.  The researchers found that women who drank moderate amounts of alcohol were somewhat less likely to have infertility than women who did not.  The study said it "controlled for age, income, and religion." 
1. In 2001 [a report in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute](http://bogbit.com/does-working-night-shifts-increase-the-risk-of-breast-cancer/) indicated that women who work at night have a 60% greater risk of developing breast cancer. Researchers based these findings on the work histories of 763 women with breast cancer and 741 women without the disease.
1. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is currently compiling a registry of patients with Fabry disease, an inherited metabolic disorder. The Fabry disease registry is open to any patient who chooses to participate and is an anonymous list. The registry includes information about the patients' health and allows doctors to follow changes in their symptoms and test results over time. It also allows doctors to compare symptoms between patients who are receiving certain therapies with those who are not receiving therapy.

## Types of Observational Studies II
For each question below, identify whether it represents a voluntary response, convenience, or random sample. Explain your reasoning.

1. A researcher is interested in the makes of cars found in Ashland.  She calls a random sample of Ashland phone numbers and asks the respondents if they will take her survey.  If they do, she records the make of car they own.
1. The manager at Burger King is interested in customer satisfaction.  To get a handle on this he provides each customer with a short survey card to be completed and returned to a collection box on the front counter.

## Identify Response and Explanatory Variables II
Identify the response variable in each of the following situations. Explain your reasoning.

1. Amount of rainfall and sales of umbrellas (in New York City).
1. The age and weight of a child (measured over time).

## Softball Bats and Balls
<img src="zimgs/pitchingmachine.jpg" alt="Pitching Machine" class="img-right">
A student wanted to see how far she could hit two brands of softballs with three types of bats.  The three bats were all 34 inches long, weighed 34 ounces, and looked similar.  Four new balls of each brand were placed into a pitching machine in a random order (the student did not know which brand of ball was being pitched).  The student picked one brand of bat at random to hit each of the eight pitched balls (for simplicity, assume that each ball was hit the first time it was pitched).  The student measured and recorded the distance (in feet) that each ball was hit.  This process was repeated for each bat.

1. Explain why this is an observational or experimental study.
1. What is the response variable?
1. What kind of variable is the response variable?
1. What are the factors? [*List all of them.*]
1. How many levels are there? [*List in same order as factors in answer b.*]
1. How many treatments are there?
1. Physically, what is a replicate (not a number)?
1. How many replicates are there?
1. Describe how you would use randomization in this experiment. Use R to construct a specific randomization using your randomization strategy.
