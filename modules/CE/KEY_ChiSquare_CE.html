<strong>Note:</strong>
<ul>
<li>
Make sure to describe your evidence in Step 3 for why you are performing a chi-square test. It is not adequate to simply say “because there is a categorical response variable and two or more groups are being tests.” At least say what the response variable is and what the groups are.
</li>
<li>
When testing the assumptions (Step 5), make sure to explicitly say that there are more than five in each cell of the expected table. It is not adequate to simply make the expected table.
</li>
<li>
In hand-calculation questions (e.g., hurricanes) make sure to put <code>lower.tail=FALSE</code> in <code>distrib()</code> when calculating the p-value (Step 8) in a chi-square problem. This is true for EVERY chi-square problem.
</li>
<li>
You values may differ slightly from mine as I calculate everything in R that holds many decimal places on intermediate values.

A chi-square test is required because a categorical response variable with three levels (strength category) from two groups or populations (time periods) was recorded.

This is an observational study without obvious randomization.

The test statistic computed below should reasonably follow a chi-square distribution because all cells in the expected table (Table 1) have values greater than five.

H<sub>A</sub>: “The distribution of students into the goals categories differs among grades” and H<sub>O</sub>: “The distribution of students into the goals categories DOES NOT differ among grades”.

<li>
Chi-square test because (i) the response variable (goals category) is categorial and (ii) two or more groups or populations (grades) were sampled.

<li>
This is an observational study because the students were not allocated to grades. The students were not obviously randomly selected (and were likely part of a voluntary response survey).
</li>
<li>
All cells in the expected frequency table (Table 4) were greater than 5; the assumptions for a chi-square test have been met.

It appears that the distributions of goals by students does not differ by grade. Analysis of the row percentage table (Table 7) suggests that grades are the primary goal for each grade.

A chi-square test is required because a categorical response variable with four levels (race/ethnicity) from two groups or populations (sex) was recorded.

This is an observational study without obvious randomization.

The H<sub>O</sub> is rejected because the p-value&lt;α.

It appears that the distribution of the individuals into the races/ethnicities differs between the sexes. An analysis of the row percentages table (Table 10) shows that there are many more white males and black females than would be expected.

Chi-square test because (i) the response variable (time since last fire) is categorial (in the way it was recorded) and (ii) two or more groups or populations (stand types) were sampled.

This is an observational study because the stand type was not set or manipulated by the researcher. The stands were not obviously randomly selected.
