<ul>
<li>
Make sure to describe your evidence in Step 3 for why you are performing a chi-square test. It is not adequate to simply say “because there is a categorical response variable and two or more groups are being tests.” At least say what the response variable is and what the groups are.
</li>
<li>
When testing the assumptions (Step 5), make sure to explicitly say that there are more than five in each cell of the expected table. It is not adequate to simply make the expected table.
</li>
<li>
In hand-calculation questions (e.g., AIDS cases) make sure to put <code>lower.tail=FALSE</code> in <code>distrib()</code> when calculating the p-value (Step 8) in a chi-square problem. This is true for EVERY chi-square problem.

H<sub>O</sub>: “The distribution of people in the race categories is the same for males and females” versus H<sub>A</sub>: “The distribution of people in the race categories is NOT the same for males and females.”
</li>
<li>
A chi-square test is required because a categorical response variable with four levels (race/ethnicity) from two groups or populations (sex) was recorded.
</li>
<li>
This is an observational study without obvious randomization.
</li>
<li>
The test statistic computed below should reasonably follow a chi-square distribution because all cells in the expected table (Table 9) have values greater than five.
</li>
<p>Table 9: Expected frequency table for distribution of individuals into race and sex categories.</p>
<pre><code>         White   Black Hispanic Other

<li>
The χ<sup>2</sup> test statistic is 1650.8 with 3 df (Table 11).
</li>
<p>Table 11: Results from the chi-square test for examining the distribution of races by male and female.</p>
<pre><code>X-squared = 1650.767, df = 3, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16</code></pre>

The p-value is &lt;0.00005.

<li>
The H<sub>O</sub> is rejected because the p-value&lt;α.
</li>
<li>
It appears that the distribution of the individuals into the races/ethnicities differs between the sexes. An analysis of the row percentages table (Table 12) shows that there are many more white males and black females than would be expected.

H<sub>A</sub>: “The distribution of students into the goals categories differs among grades” and H<sub>O</sub>: “The distribution of students into the goals categories DOES NOT differ among grades”.

Chi-square test because (i) the response variable (goals category) is categorial and (ii) two or more groups or populations (grades) were sampled.
</li>
<li>
This is an observational study because the students were not allocated to grades. The students were not obviously randomly selected (and were likely part of a voluntary response survey).
</li>
<li>
All cells in the expected frequency table (Table 1) were greater than 5; the assumptions for a chi-square test have been met.

This is an observational study because the stand type was not set or manipulated by the researcher. The stands were not obviously randomly selected.
