<h2>Types of Variables I</h2>
<ol>
<li>Miles driven per week is quantitative, <strong>continuous</strong> because another value CAN be found between any two miles driven values (e.g., a student can drive between 10 and 10.1 miles per week, between 10 and 10.01 miles per week, and so on).</li>
<li>Type of vehicle is categorical, <strong>nominal</strong> because the types represent groups but there is no order among the groups.</li>
<li>Signs of disease is categorical, <strong>nominal</strong> because “yes” and “no” are groups and a categorical variables with two levels is nominal by definition.</li>
<li>Number of fleas is quantitative, <strong>discrete</strong> because another value can NOT be found between all pairs of numbers of fleas (e.g., there cannot be between 10 and 11 fleas).</li>
<li>Relative health of a rabbit is categorical, <strong>ordinal</strong> because the health was organized by groups (e.g., excellent) and those groupings were ordered.</li>
<li>Species of rabbit is categorical, <strong>nominal</strong> because species is a type of group, but there is no order among those groups.</li>
<li>Number of correct answers is quantitative, <strong>discrete</strong> because a value can NOT be found between all pairs of correct answers (e.g., there cannot be between 19 and 20 correct answers).</li>
<li>Concentration of lead is quantitative, <strong>continuous</strong> because a value CAN be found between any pair of lead concentrations.</li>
<li>Risk potential is categorical, <strong>ordinal</strong> because a grouping was created (e.g., “high risk”) and those groupings have an order.</li>
<li>Information medium is categorical, <strong>nominal</strong> because they are types, but those types do not have an ordering.</li>
<li>The Koppen scheme is definitely categorical and I think it is <strong>nominal</strong> because I don’t see an ordering in the given categories (i.e., they don’t appear to range from wet to dry, cold to hot, north to south).</li>

<strong>Note:</strong>
<ul>
<li>
The specificity in the description for the individual (usually specific about “when” and “where”).
</li>
<li>
The use of “ALL” when describing the population and parameter.
</li>
<li>
The list of a specific number of individuals when describing the sample and statistic.
</li>
<li>
The use of a specific type of summary (almost always the mean/average or percentage/proportion) when describing the parameter and statistic. Further note that the same summary word is used for both the parameter and statistic.
</li>
<li>
A summary word usually does not appear in the description of the variable.
</li>
<li>
The variable type must be one of continuous, discrete, nominal, or ordinal (saying quantitative or categorical is not specific enough).

<h2>Sustainability Survey</h2>

<li>I - A Northland College Student in Fall, 2013</li>
<li>V - Number of miles driven per week</li>
<li>Po - <strong>ALL</strong> Northland College Students in Fall, 2013</li>

<li>Sa - 147 sampled Northland College students</li>
<li>St - <em>Average</em> number of miles driven per week by 147 sampled Northland College Students in Fall, 2013</li>
<li>Variable Type - Miles driven per week is quantitative, continuous because another value can be found been any two miles driven.</li>

<li>St - <em>mean</em> carapace length of 235 Rusty Crayfish in the lake with Smallmouth Bass in 2015</li>
<li>Variable Type - Carapace length is a continuous quantitative variable because a carapace length can be found between any two carapace lengths.</li>
