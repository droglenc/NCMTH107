## Acid Rain in Shenandoah National Park
<img src="zimgs/rose-river-falls.jpg" alt="Shenandoah National Park" class="img-right">

The pH scales falls between 0 and 14 with values <7 considered acidic and values >7 considered basic. Rain water is naturally acidic, usually around 5.6 on the pH scale. Thus, the EPA defines rainwater with a pH less than 5.6 as being "acid rain." A series of rain collection samples were taken at the Big Meadows Station in the Shenandoah National Park, VA with the results stored in pHlevels.csv ([data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/pHlevels.csv), [meta](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/pHlevels_meta.txt)). Use these data to determine, at the 1% level, if there is evidence for "acid rain" at this site.[^1]

## Thickness of the Ozone Layer
<img src="zimgs/ozone-hole.jpg" alt="Ozone Hole" class="img-right">
The typical thickness of the ozone layer over the Earth's surface is 300 [Dobson units](http://ozonewatch.gsfc.nasa.gov/facts/dobson_SH.html).  Researchers at the Laboratorium f√ºr Atmospharensphysic in Switzerland recorded the thickness of the ozone layer over [Arosa, Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arosa) from 1926 to the present.  The data in OzoneSWI.csv ([file](https://github.com/droglenc/NCData/raw/master/OzoneSWI.csv), [meta](https://github.com/droglenc/NCData/blob/master/OzoneSWI_meta.txt)) contains the measurements from a random sample of 45 years between 1926 and the mid 1990s.  Use these data to determine, at the 1% level, if the thickness of the ozone layer over Arosa is different than that which is typical for the Earth's surface.[^3]
