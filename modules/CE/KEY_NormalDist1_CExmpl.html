<h2>Wood Duck Weights</h2>
<ol>
<li>
The percentage of wood ducks that weight between 350 and 550 g is 95%.
</li>
</ol>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p>
This follows directly from the middle part of the 68-95-99.7% Rule because 350 is exactly 2σ below μ and 550 is exactly 2σ above μ.

</div>
<p> </p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
The percentage of wood ducks that weight more than 550 g is 2.5%.
</li>
</ol>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p>
We see that 550 is exactly 2σ above μ. Thus, there is 95% between 350 (2σ below μ) and 550, 5% outside of that range, and 2.5% in each tail outside of that range. Thus, 2.5% are greater than 550.

</div>
<p> </p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
The percentage of wood ducks that weigh less than 400 g is 16%
</li>
</ol>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p>
We see that 400 is exactly 1σ below μ. Thus, there is 68% between 400 and 500 (1σ above μ), 32% outside of that range, and 16% in each tail outside of that range. Thus, 16% are less than 400.
</p>
<p><img src="KEY_NormalDist1_CExmpl_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="336" /></p>
</div>
<p> </p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
The percentage of wood ducks that weigh less than 500 g is 84%
</li>
</ol>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p>
Referring to the plot in the previous question, we see that 500 is exactly 1σ above μ, there is 68% between 400 and 500, and 16% in each tail outside of that range. Thus, the percentage less than 500 g is the 68% between 400 and 500 g plus the 16% that is less than 400 g; for a total of 84%.
</p>
</div>
<p> </p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
The percentage of wood ducks that weigh between 300 and 500 g is 83.85%
</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
The most common 68% of wood ducks weigh between 400 and 500 g.
</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<ol start="7">
<li>
The lightest (smallest) 16% of wood ducks weight less than 400 g.
</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<ol start="8">
<li>
The heaviest 2.5% of wood ducks weigh more than 550 g.
</li>
</ol>
