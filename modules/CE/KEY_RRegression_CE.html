# Sign Legibility and Age



1. The response variable is **maximum distance** to see the sign. [*Note that distance to see the sign depends on age and distance to see the sign is what is predicted or explained in the ensuing questions.*]
1. The explanatory variable is **age**.
1. The best-fit line is **distance=-3.01$\times$age+576.7**.
1. The slope indicates that for every increase of one year in age the maximum distance to see the sign will decrease by **3.01 ft**, on average.
1. The intercept indicates that if the age of the driver was zero, then the maximum distance to see the sign would be **576.7 ft**, on average.
1. The predicted maximum distance to see the sign for a 30-year-old driver is **486.5 ft**.
1. This prediction should not be made as an age of 90 is outside the observed results for this variable (see plot below) and is, thus, an **extrapolation**.
1. The residual for an individual that is 50-years-old and had a maximum distance to see the sign of 410 ft is 410-426.3=**-16.3 ft**. Thus, this individual would have a shorter maximum distance to see the sign than an average 50-year-old.
1. The correlation coefficient between age of the driver and maximum distance to see the sign is **-0.80**.
1. The proportion of variability in maximum distance to see the sign that is explained by knowing the age of the driver is **0.64**.
1. If the age of the driver increased by ten years then the predicted maximum distance to see the sign would decrease by ten slopes or **30.07 ft**.
1. I **don't have any strong concerns**, though the data look very slightly nonlinear and very slightly heteroscedastic (see plot below).

<li>The response variable is the index of <strong>fawn recruitment</strong>. [<em>Note that the index of fawn recruitment could depend on the RIFA index and the RIFA index is what is predicted or explained in the ensuing questions.</em>]</li>
<li>The explanatory variable is <strong>RIFA index</strong>.</li>
<li>The best-fit line is <strong>fawnrec=-0.000209<span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span>RIFA+0.854</strong>.</li>
<li>The slope indicates that for every increase of one for the RIFA index the index of fawn recruitment will decrease by <strong>0.000209</strong>, on average.</li>
<li>The intercept indicates that if the RIFA index was zero, then the index of fawn recruitment would be <strong>0.854</strong>, on average.</li>
<li>If the RIFA index increased by 500 then the predicted index of fawn recruitment would decrease by 500 slopes or <strong>0.105</strong>.</li>
<li>This prediction should not be made as a RIFA index of 500 is outside the observed results for this variable (see plot below) and is, thus, an <strong>extrapolation</strong>.</li>
<li>The predicted index of fawn recruitment if the RIFA index is 1700 is <strong>0.498</strong>.</li>
<li>The residual for an individual with a RIFA index of 2200 and a fawn recruitment index of 0.3 is 0.3-0.393=<strong>-0.093</strong>. Thus, this individual would have a lower fawn recruitment than the average for locations with a RIFA index of 2200.</li>
<li>The correlation coefficient between RIFA and fawn recruitment indices is <strong>-0.700</strong>.</li>
<li>The proportion of variability in the index of fawn recruitment that is explained by knowing the RIFA index is <strong>0.49</strong>.</li>
<li>I <strong>donâ€™t have any strong concerns</strong> as the data appear linear (i.e., there is no obvious curve) and homoscedastic (i.e., there is no funnel or cone shape evident).</li>
