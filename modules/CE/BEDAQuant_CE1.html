<h2>Scatterplots</h2>

The scatterplot below illustrates the relationship between the percent of female Kingfishers and the latitude of the survey.</p>

<p>Use this scatterplot to answer these questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>What is an individual in this example?</li>
<li>What types of variables are the two variables used here?</li>
<li>What was the maximum latitude examined?</li>
<li>What was the minimum percent of females observed?</li>
<li>What are the values for both variables for the point at the very top of the plot?</li>
<li>How many surveys recorded fewer than 30% female Kingfishers?</li>
<li>How many surveys were between 40 and 45<sup>o</sup>N?</li>
<li>What is the association exhibited in this plot?</li>
</ol>

<h2>Associations I</h2>
<p>For each situation below, identify (a) the response variable (if possible) and (b) whether you would expect a positive, negative, or no (neutral) association between the pair of variables. Explain your reasoning for both answers.</p>
<ol>
<li>Weight and gas mileage of a car.</li>
<li>Proportion of the population that was vaccinated and proportion of the population that became ill.</li>
<li>The expected salary of an individual and how many years they invested in post-secondary education.</li>
<li>Exam score and age of the student’s mother.</li>
<li>Mean summer temperature and proportion of households that have an air conditioner (recorded for communities from across the U.S.).</li>

<h2>Animal Fat and Breast Cancer</h2>
<p><img src="zimgs/fat_intake.jpg" alt="Fat Intake" class="img-right"> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1104150">Carroll (1975)</a> examined the relationship between per capita consumption of animal fat (g/day) and age-adjusted death rate from breast cancer for 39 countries. Use the following results from her data to describe the bivariate relationship between these two variables (i.e., perform a bivariate EDA).</p>

<div id="religiosity" class="section level2">
<h2>Religiosity</h2>
<p>Researchers have long examined relationships between “religiosity” (a general term that attempts to measure “how religious” a group of people is) and various factors. In one such study, researchers compared the percent of respondents within a state that stated that religion was either “important” or “very important” to them and the life expectancy at birth by state.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Their results are shown below. Use these results to complete a thorough bivariate EDA.</p>
