## Loading Data from Webpage I
Download the BrainHead.csv([file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/BrainHead.csv){:target="_blank"}/[meta](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/BrainHead_meta.txt){:target="_blank"}) data file from the class webpage into your "R Directory", load the data into a data.frame in R, and show the `str()`ucture of the data.frame. From the structure, identify (i) how many variables, (ii) the names of the variables, and (iii) how many individuals are in the data.frame.

## Loading Your Own Data I
Record three variables (at least one quantitative and one categorical) about at least five individuals in this classroom. [*Don't be shy*] Enter these data into a CSV file, load the data into a data.frame in R, and show the entire data.frame (i.e., all variables and all individuals). From this make sure that there are as many variables and individuals as you expected and that the variables are named as you expected.
