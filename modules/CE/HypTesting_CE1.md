## Identifying Hypotheses

For each research hypothesis or statement below, construct the null and alternative hypotheses (use their respective symbols) and explicitly define the parameter in the hypotheses.

1. The mean number of murders per burrough in New York City in 2010 was less than 90.
1. The Toyota dealership has advertised that oil changes will be completed in 15 minutes or less. Test whether their advertisement is incorrect, on average.
1. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases reports that the average cost of bariatric (weight loss) surgery is $22,500. You think that this information is incorrect. 
1. Washburn High School publicizes that 61% of its students are involved in at least one extracurricular activity. A parent organization believes that the percentage is higher.

<div class="alert alert-success">
I urge you to follow these steps when answering all p-value-related questions:
<ol type="a">
  <li>Identify H<sub>0</sub> and H<sub>A</sub>. If the question has a context then the parameter should be stated within that context.</li>
  <li>Define the p-value specific to the situation.</li>
  <li>Draw the null distribution.</li>
  <li>Compute the p-value.</li>
  <li>Make a decision about H<sub>0</sub>. If the question has a context then the conclusion should be stated within that context.</li>
</ol>
A reminder to use these steps will <strong>NOT</strong> be provided on future quizzes, but you should get in the habit of following them. See <a href="../Explanations/Calc_pvalue_Z.html">here</a> for a demonstration of the steps.

## P-Value Calculations and Decisions I
Compute the p-value (see the steps suggested above) and make a decision about H<sub>0</sub> for each situation below.

1. H<sub>A</sub>: &mu;&#8800;14, &sigma;=6, n=25, x&#772;=11.2, &alpha;=0.05.
1. H<sub>A</sub>: &mu;>75, &sigma;=12, n=50, x&#772;=79.5, &alpha;=0.10.
1. H<sub>A</sub>: &mu;<15000, &sigma;=8000, n=50, x&#772;=13700, &alpha;=0.10.
