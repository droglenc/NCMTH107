<h2>Preference for Bottled Water?</h2>

H<sub>A</sub>: “There is a preference among the water choices (i.e., the distribution of students will NOT follow a theoretical distribution of equal proportions among the water choices)” and H<sub>0</sub>: “There is no preference among the water choices (i.e., the distribution of students will follow a theoretical distribution of equal proportions among the water choices)”.
</li>
<li>
Goodness-of-fit test because (i) one group or population (students) were sampled and (ii) the response variable (water choice) is categorial.
</li>
<li>
This is quasi-experimental as the students were given a choice of only certain waters. The students were not obviously randomly selected (and were likely part of a voluntary response survey).
</li>
<li>
All cells in the expected frequency table (Table 1) were greater than 5; the assumptions for a goodness-of-fit test have been met. [Note that these expected values equal 107/4 to represent no preference in choice of water.]
</li>

The observed frequency table is shown in Table 2.

It appears that there is a preference for water type by the students. Further examination suggests that the students least-preferred the tap water.

<h2>Habitat Use by Wild Turkeys</h2>

<li>
H<sub>A</sub>: “There is a preference by the turkeys for habitat (i.e., the distribution of turkeys will NOT follow the (theoretical) distribution of available habitats)” and H<sub>0</sub>: “There is NOT a preference by the turkeys for habitat (i.e., the distribution of turkeys will follow the (theoretical) distribution of available habitats)”.
</li>
<li>
Goodness-of-fit test because (i) one group or population (South Dakota turkeys) were sampled and (ii) the response variable (habitat use) is categorical.
</li>
<li>
This is observational as habitat use by the turkeys was simply recorded. The turkey observations were not randomly selected (the researchers likely chose days to sample).
</li>
<li>
All cells in the expected frequency table (Table 3) were greater than 5; the assumptions for a goodness-of-fit test have been met. [Note that these expected values are equal to 878 total observations times the proportions of available habitat to represent no preference in choosing habitat types by the turkeys.]
</li>

p-value&lt;0.00005 (somewhat more specifically 4.77e-06).
</li>
<li>
Reject H<sub>0</sub> because the p-value&lt;α.
</li>
<li>
It appears that the turkeys show a habitat preference in the spring. Further analysis suggests that the turkeys showed a strong avoidance of meadows, a moderate avoidance of Oak/Spruce habitats, and a moderate preference for aspen and pine habitats.

</li>
<li>
Goodness-of-fit test because (i) one group or population (the jury in this district) were sampled and (ii) the response variable (age category) is categorial.
</li>
<li>
This is observational as the jurors were not allocated to ages. In theory the jury was randomly selected from the district, but that is what is being tested.

All cells in the expected frequency table (Table 5) were greater than 5; the assumptions for a goodness-of-fit test have been met.

It appears that the age distribution of the jury does not match the age distribution of the district as a whole. Further examination suggests that the jury has a higher percentage of older jurors (ages “40-49” and “50-64”) and a lower percentage of younger jurors (ages “18-19”, “20-24”, and “25-29”) than expected as based on the age distribution in the district as a whole.
