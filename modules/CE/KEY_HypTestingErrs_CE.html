<h2>Identifying Type I and II Errors</h2>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
<strong>Note:</strong>
<ul>
<li>
In these two questions, I would first write the H<sub>0</sub> and H<sub>A</sub> as in the last module. I would then write these hypothesis in words relative to the research hypothesis. For example, in the first question, H<sub>0</sub> is that the chicken is not contaminated whereas H<sub>A</sub> is that the chicken is contaminated. I then write the definitions of Type I (H<sub>0</sub> is true, but it is rejected) and Type II (H<sub>0</sub> is false, but is not rejected) errors, but with the wordy meanings of the hypotheses substituted in appropriately.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
The H<sub>0</sub>: μ=15.4 and H<sub>A</sub>: μ&gt;15.4. A Type I error is saying that the chicken is contaminated (rejecting H<sub>0</sub>) when it really is not contaminated (H<sub>0</sub> is true). A Type II error is saying that the chicken is not contaminated (not rejecting H<sub>0</sub>) when it really is contaminated (H<sub>0</sub> is false). In my mind, a Type II error is more egregious as people would be eating contaminated chicken that they have been told is not contaminated.
</li>
<li>
The H<sub>0</sub> is that the drug does not exceed the specification whereas the H<sub>A</sub> is that the drug does exceed the specification. A Type I error occurs if the drug is not bad (H<sub>0</sub> is true) but it is concluded that is bad (rejecting H<sub>0</sub>). A Type II error occurs if the drug is bad (H<sub>0</sub> is false) but it is concluded that the drug is not bad (not rejecting H<sub>0</sub>). In my mind, a Type II error is more egregious as people would be using a “bad” drug that they were told was not bad.

<h2>How to Reduce β</h2>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
<strong>Note:</strong>
<ul>
<li>
In question 1 below you are asked to prove that the rejection wall is at 97 (within rounding). This requires finding the value of the sample mean that has α “more extreme” (as dictated by the H<sub>A</sub>) on the “null distribution” (sampling distribution assuming that H<sub>O</sub> is true). This is always a reverse calculation and, given this H<sub>A</sub>, is a reverse-left calculation.
</li>
<li>
In question 2 below you are asked to prove that β is 0.137 (within rounding). This requires finding the area in the “Do Not Reject H<sub>0</sub>” region of “actual distribution” (sampling distribution assuming that μ equals the actual mean provided). This is always a forward calculation and always in the opposite direction of the reverse calculation in quation 1; thus, a forward-right calculation in this instance.

Effects on β
</li>
<ol>
<li>
Increasing α will DEcrease β
</li>
<li>
Increasing n will DEcrease β
</li>
<li>
Increasing σ will INcrease β
</li>
<li>
Increasing how wrong the H<sub>0</sub> is will DEcrease β
</li>
</ol>
<li>
β may be DEcreased by INcreasing n or INcreasing α.
</li>
<li>
Power may be INcreased by INcreasing n or INcreasing α.
