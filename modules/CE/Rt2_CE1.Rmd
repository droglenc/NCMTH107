## Delivering Military Supplies
<img src="http://derekogle.com/NCMTH107/modules/CE/zimgs/navy-shipping.jpg" alt="Navy Shipping" class="img-right">
Following the [Persian Gulf War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War), the Pentagon changed its logistics processes from following a "just-in-case" mentality to following a "just-in-time" system. With this change deliveries from factories to foxholes were expedited using bar codes, laser cards, radio tags, and databases to track supplies. The data below contains order-to-delivery times (in days) for shipments from the United States to the Persian Gulf in 1991 (old system) and shipments to Bosnia in 1995 (new system). Use these data to determine, at the 5% level, if the mean delivery rates declined significantly under the new system. Assume that the distributions of delivery times are approxiately normally distributed.[^2]

<pre>
Persian Gulf 28.0 20.0 26.5 10.6 9.1 35.2 29.1 41.2 27.5
Bosnia       15.1  6.4  5.0 11.4 6.5  6.5  3.0  7.0  3.5
