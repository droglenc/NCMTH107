The results from the study described in the [2-sample t-test class example](2Samplet_CExmpl) were recorded in PlasticRecycling.csv ([data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/Cholesterol2.csv), [meta](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/Cholesterol2_meta.txt)). Use these data (note that you will need to create a variable that contains the reduction in LDL levels for each subject) and `t.test()` to confirm your calculations in the previous exercise.
