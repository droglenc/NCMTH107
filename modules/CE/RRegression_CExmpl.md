## Climate Change Data
The results from the study described in the [linear regression class example](LinearRegression_CExmpl) were recorded in GSI_data.csv ([data](http://derekogle.com/NCMTH107/modules/CE/GSI_data.csv)). Use these and `lm()` to obtain the results and confirm your calculations in that exercise.
