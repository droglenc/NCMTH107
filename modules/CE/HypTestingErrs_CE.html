<h2>Identifying Type I and II Errors</h2>
<p>In each situation below, describe what a Type I and a Type II error is and make an argument for which error is more egregious. [<em>Hint: begin by identifying H<sub>0</sub> and H<sub>A</sub> and then writing what these hypotheses mean in words.</em>]</p>

<li>The United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) limit for salmonella contamination for chicken parts is 15.4% (<a href="http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2015/01/fsis-releases-new-salmonella-campylobacter-performance-standards-for-poultry/">source</a>). Suppose that a meat inspector reports that the chicken produced by a particular company exceeds the USDA limit. A hypothesis test will be performed to determine whether the meat inspector’s claim appears to be true or not.</li>
<li>The process of manufacturing a certain drug is quite complex. Small departures from the standard procedure can result in a drug that does not meet specifications and is dangerous to the user. Before being released for use, a sample of a batch of the drug is tested to determine if the mean amount of a particular chemical in the drug exceeds specifications. A hypothesis test will be performed to determine if the safe level was exceeded.</li>

<h2>How to Reduce β</h2>
<p><img src="http://derekogle.com/NCMTH107/modules/CE/zimgs/computer-1.jpg" alt="Simulations" class="img-right">The probability of a type II error (β)<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> cannot be computed because the true population mean (μ<sub>a</sub>) is not known. However, β is affected by α, n, σ, and “how wrong” the null hypothesized value is. Simulations with known populations can be used to understand the relationships between β and these other values. Because α and n are chosen by the statistician, decisions can be made that will affect β (though we will never know the actual value of β).</p>
<p>The <code>powerSim()</code> function (with no arguments) provides an efficient method to perform these simulations. For example, <code>powerSim()</code> produced the plots shown below. The top plot is the “null distribution” or the sampling distribution of the sample means assuming that H<sub>0</sub>: μ=100 is true (and σ=10 and n=30). The rejection region that is defined by α=0.05 and assuming that H<sub>A</sub>: μ&lt;100 (i.e., lower-tailed) is shown on the null distribution as the red shaded area bound by the vertical red line. Thus, any sample mean in this shaded area would result in a decision to reject H<sub>0</sub>.</p>
<p><img src="HypTestingErrs_CE_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="480" /></p>
<p>The lower plot is the “actual distribtion” or the sampling distribution that would result if μ=95 (in this example) and σ=10 and n=30. The rejection region is projected onto this plot with the red vertical line. Because μ=95 is different than μ<sub>0</sub>=100, these graphs represent the situation where the H<sub>0</sub> is incorrect. Not rejecting H<sub>0</sub> in this situation is an incorrect decision and the probability of making that decision is β. The probability of making this error (β) is shown by the off-red shaded area on the actual distribution and is equal to the value in the upper-right corner (in this case).</p>
<p>In RStudio, these plots will have a gear icon in the upper-left corner that will open a dialog box that allows you to modify α, n, σ, and the actual population mean. The plots will update automatically when any of these items is changed. Use these plots to answer the questions below.</p>
<ol>
<li>For the default values, show that the value of the sample mean that defines the rejection region is correct. [<em>Hint: this is a reverse normal distribution calculation using the null distribution and is the first two steps outlined in the module reading.</em>]</li>
<li>For the default values, show that the value for β is correct. [<em>Hint: this is a forward normal distribution calculation using the actual distribution and is the last two steps outlined in the module reading.</em>]</li>
<li>Determine how β is affected in each of the following situations. Provide graphical or numerical evidence for each of your answers.
<ol>
<li>Increasing α.</li>
<li>Increasing n.</li>
<li>Increasing σ.</li>
<li>Increasing “how wrong” the H<sub>0</sub> is.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>What decisions can you, as a statistician, make to decrease β.</li>
<li>What decisions can you, as a statistician, make to increase power.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></li>
