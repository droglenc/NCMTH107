1. State the rejection criterion (&alpha;)
1. State the null and alternative hypotheses and define the parameter(s)
1. Determine which test to perform â€“ Explain!
1. Collect the data (address type of study and randomization)
1. Check all necessary assumption(s)
1. Calculate the appropriate statistic(s)
1. Calculate the appropriate test statistic
1. Calculate the p-value
1. State your rejection decision
1. Summarize your findings in terms of the problem 
1. **If rejected H<sub>0</sub>**, compute a 100(1-&alpha;)% confidence region for  parameter
