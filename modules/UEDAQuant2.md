It is important to understand the distribution of individuals for a single variable. With quantitative data, four characteristics are generally described from several graphs and numerical summaries. Constructing these graphs and computing these numerical summaries were described in the previous module. Using those results to construct a synthetic description of the distribution of a quantitative variable is described in this module.

<p>After completing this module, you should be able to ...</p>

<ol>
  <li>Use graphs to describe the shape of a distribution.</li>
  <li>Use graphs to describe outliers in a distribution.</li>
  <li>Identify which summary statistics are appropriate in a given situation.</li>
  <li>Construct a succinct written summary that addresses the four key characteristics (shape, outliers, center, and dispersion) of the distribution of a quantitative variable.</li>
