## Cholesterol Drug Treatments I
<img src="http://derekogle.com/NCMTH107/modules/zimgs/cholesterol_blood_test.jpg" alt="Cholesterol test" class="img-right">

[Low density lipoprotein (LDL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_lipoprotein) is often called "bad cholesterol" because they can cause lipids to be deposited in artery walls, thus causing arteries to become blocked.  Levels of LDL may be lowered with lifestyle changes and pharmaceuticals.  Researchers conducted an experiment where 25 men with high cholesterol were randomly assigned one of two drugs (Befizal and Lipanthyl) designed to lower LDL levels.  The results from this test are shown below.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3.5, fig.width=7}
d <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/Cholesterol2.csv")
d$decrease <- d$before-d$after
Summarize(decrease~tx,data=d,digits=3)
levenesTest(decrease~tx,data=d)
hist(decrease~tx,data=d,xlab="Reduction in LDL (g/l)")
```

Determine, at the 5% level, if there is a difference in the mean decrease in LDL between the two drugs.  Make sure to provide explicit answers with your work shown for all [11 steps of a hypothesis test](../Hypothesis_Testing/11-steps.html).

## Cholesterol Drug Treatments II

The results from the previous experiment were recorded in Cholesterol2.csv ([file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/Cholesterol2.csv), [meta](https://github.com/droglenc/NCData/blob/master/Cholesterol2_meta.txt)).  Use these data (note that you will need to create a variable that contains the reduction in LDL levels for each subject) to confirm your calculations in the previous exercise.

```{r echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
levenesTest(decrease~tx,data=d)
t.test(decrease~tx,data=d,var.equal=TRUE)
```
