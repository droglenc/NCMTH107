## IVPPSS Questions

Perform a thorough IVPPSS for each situation below. Make sure to explicitly identify an individual, use appropriate specific words for the population and parameter and the sample sample statistic, and use an appropriate summary for the parameter and statistic.

A few of these biologists tested to see if a certain pheromone released by injured ruffe would repel other ruffe. If so, natural, or possibly synthetic, versions of this pheromone could be used to distract ruffe from areas in which they are causing damage. In their experiment, they observed ruffe held in aquaria divided into four sections. They recorded what proportion of 24 randomly-selected ruffe caught in the St. Louis River Harbor, and then held in the aquaria, left a section when the chemical was added to that section.
