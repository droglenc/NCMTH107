## Preparation for Class

Complete the following items to be prepared for the first day of class.

* [Initiate MSTeams Discussion Site](Prep/GetOrganized_MSTeams){:target="_blank"}
* [Initiate Gradescope Grading Site](Prep/GetOrganized_Gradescope){:target="_blank"}
* [Complete Webpage Scavenger Hunt](Prep/GetOrganized_Hunt){:target="_blank"}

The next items will not be needed until the second day of class but I suggest trying to prepare these for the first day of class so that if you have questions or problems then you will have sufficient time to contact me for help.

* [Install R, RStudio, NCStats](Prep/RStart.html#installing-r-rstudio-ncstats){:target="_blank"}
    * [Setup and Brief Introduction to R/RStudio](Prep/RStart.html#what-is-r-and-rstudio){:target="_blank"}
