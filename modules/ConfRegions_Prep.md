To prepare for this module, please answer the following questions from the preparation readings and videos. Please contact the professor if you have questions.

1. What do we hope is contained within the bounds of a confidence interval?
1. How many 95% confidence regions contain the parameter of interest? 90%? 99%?
1. How often will you make an incorrect conclusion about the value of the parameter if you use a 95% confidence region? 90%? 99%?
1. How is the level of confidence (C) determined from &alpha;?
1. How is the alternative hypothesis used to decide whether to construct a confidence interval, lower confidence bound, or upper confidence bound?
1. What are the five steps in computing a proper confidence region?
1. If the value in the null hypothesis is contained within a confidence region, will that null hypothesis be rejected or not rejected?
1. What does the relative width of a confidence interval tell us about how the parameter is estimated? [*i.e., how does a narrow confidence interval compare to a wide one in terms of estimating the parameter.*]
1. What decisions can a statistician make that will result in a narrower confidence interval? Which decision is "better"?
1. What is the formula for computing a desired sample size? What do you need to know or be able to define to use this formula?
1. What R code do you use to find the scaling factor used to construct a confidence region?
1. Find $Z^{*}$ (to three decimals) for each situation in the table below.

|  C  |   Interval   | Lower Bound | Upper Bound |
|:---:|:------------:|:-----------:|-------------|
| 90% |              |             |             |
| 95% |              |             |             |
| 99% |              |             |             |
