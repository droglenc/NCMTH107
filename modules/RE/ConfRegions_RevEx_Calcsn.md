Geologists measure the longest axis of pebbles to determine "grain" sizes. If the standard deviation of pebble long-axis length for a particular site is known to be 4 mm, how many pebbles must be measured in order to determine the average pebble length within 0.1 mm with 99% confidence?

An investment group wants to start an Internet Service Provider (ISP) and, for their business plan and model, needs to estimate the average Internet usage of households. How many households must be randomly selected to be 95% sure that the sample mean is within 1 minute of the population mean?  Assume that a previous survey of household usage had a standard deviation of 6.95 minutes.

## Counting Plants in Plots

Suppose that a plant ecologist is to examine a very large tract of land that has been subdivided into 1400 plots of 10 m<sup>2</sup> (10 square meters). The researcher wants to determine, with 90% confidence, the mean density of plants per plot for the entire tract of land to within 10 plants per plot. A pilot study indicated that the standard deviation was approximately 50 plants per plot. Determine how many 10 m<sup>2</sup> plots the researcher should examine to reach her stated goals.
