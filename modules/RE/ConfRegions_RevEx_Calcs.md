## BOD in Effluent
<img src="zimgs/BOD_test_bottles.jpg" alt="BOD Test Bottles" class="img-right">

The managers of a wastewater treatment plant monitored the amount of biological oxygen demand (BOD; lbs/day) in the effluent of the plant each month from January 1991 to October 2000. The managers would need to take corrective actions if the average BOD over this time period was significantly greater than 2200 lbs/day at a 10% rejection level. Previous studies indicated that the standard deviation was 1200 lbs/day. Summary statistics from their sample of days is given below.

```
    n  Min. 1st Qu. Median   Mean  3rd Qu.   Max.
  118   630    1600    2240   2504     3193    6023
```

Use this information to construct and interpret (including describing what is meant by "confidence"") a proper confidence region for the mean BOD level.

## Medical School Admissions
<img src="zimgs/medschool_lecture.jpg" alt="Medical School Lecture" class="img-right">

Admissions representatives at the University of Minnesota medical school were concerned that the average grade point average of applicants in non-science courses had dropped below 3.7. A sample of 40 of the most recent applicants indicated that the mean was 3.60. Information from the Association of American Medical Colleges suggested that the overall standard deviation was 0.35. Construct and interpret (including describing what is meant by "confidence") a proper confidence region for the mean grade point average. Assume that &alpha;=0.05.

## Banff Snow Depth
<img src="zimgs/banff-snow.jpg" alt="Banff Snow" class="img-right">

[Hebblewhite *et al.* (2000)](http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/z02-058?journalCode=cjz#.WU7Rv1GQyDI) reported the mean snow pack height (in cm) for Banff (data are below). Assume that it is known that &sigma;=15 cm.

```
29.00,45.51,30.18,45.83,39.54,80.39,32.64,32.89,
46.84,45.79,62.92,67.24,30.96,46.08,33.28
```

Compute a 99% confidence interval for the mean snow pack height. In addition, comment on whether or not a confidence interval should be computed for these data (note: compute the CI in (A) regardless of your answer here).

## Creatine Phosphate Concentrations
<img src="zimgs/creatine_phosphate.jpg" alt="Creatine Phosphate" class="img-right">

The table below contains the concentrations (International Units per liter) of creatine phosphokinase (an enzyme related to muscle and brain functions) in 36 male volunteers. Construct and interpret (including describing what is meant by "confidence") a proper confidence region for the population mean creatine phosphokinase assuming that the H<sub>A</sub> is a "greater than", &alpha;=0.05, and &sigma;=40.

```
121  82 100 151  68  58  95 145  64
119 104 110 113 118 203  62  83  67
201 101 163  84  57 139  60  78  94
 93  92 110  25 123  70  48  95  42

The following values are the maximum gage heights (feet) of the Bois Brule River in Brule, WI from 10-25Feb05. 

```
1.56 1.54 1.54 1.57 1.58 1.61 1.60 1.69
1.99 2.11 1.98 1.76 1.69 1.99 1.86 1.53
```

Construct and interpret (including describing what is meant by "confidence") a proper confidence region for the population mean creatine phosphokinase assuming that the H<sub>A</sub> is a "not equals", &alpha;=0.05, and &sigma;=0.20.

<img src="zimgs/Janesville.jpg" alt="Brule River" class="img-right">

The following values are the population density (number of people per acre of land) for 15 randomly selected Wisconsin counties.

```
429.0  67.8  52.1  97.4  57.9 354.9  16.2  19.1
127.0  27.6  10.2  54.6  28.8  30.1  20.2
```

Construct and interpret (including describing what is meant by "confidence") a proper confidence region for the population mean creatine phosphokinase assuming that the H<sub>A</sub> is a "less than", &alpha;=0.10, and &sigma;=125.
