## Sampling Distribution Characteristics I

Assume that the population distribution is ~N(100,20) and you take samples of n=50.
  
1. What shape would you expect the sampling distribution of the sample means to be?
1. What do you expect the center of the sampling distribution of the sample means to equal?
1. What do you expect the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample means to equal?
1. What do you expect the standard error of x&#772; to equal?

## Sampling Distribution Characteristics II

Assume that the population distribution is skewed to the right with &mu;=500 and &sigma;=60. Further suppose that samples of n=100 are taken.
  
1. What shape would you expect the sampling distribution of the sample means to be?
1. What do you expect the center of the sampling distribution of the sample means to equal?
1. What do you expect the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the means to equal?
1. What do you expect the standard error of x&#772; to equal?

## Sampling Distribution Characteristics III

Assume that the population distribution is slightly skewed to the right with &mu;=500 and &sigma;=60. Further suppose that samples of n=20 are taken.
  
1. What shape would you expect the sampling distribution of the sample means to be?
1. What do you expect the center of the sampling distribution of the sample means to equal?
1. What do you expect the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the means to equal?
1. What do you expect the standard error of x&#772; to equal?

## Accuracy and Precision

Suppose that it is known that a population has &mu;=10. Use this to answer the questions below.

1. Which is more accurate -- four samples with means of 9,10,11, and 9 or means of 6,8,7, and 9?
1. Which is more accurate -- four samples with means of 6,14,8, and 12 or means of 8,7,9, and 8?
1. Which is more precise -- four samples with means of 7,14,8, and 11 or means of 7,7,9, and 8?
1. How would you judge the accuracy and precision of four samples with means of 2,8,12, and 18?
1. How would you judge the accuracy and precision of four samples with means of 9,10,11, and 10?
1. How would you judge the accuracy and precision of four samples with means of 1,7,8, and 19?
