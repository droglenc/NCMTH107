<h2>Achievement Test Scores</h2>
<ol>
<li>α = 0.05.</li>
<li>H<sub>0</sub> μ=80, H<sub>A</sub> μ&gt;80 where μ is the average achievement test score for all students at the superintendent’s school.</li>
<li>A one-sample t-test is required because (i) a quantitative variable (achievement test score), (ii) individuals are from one group/population (one school), and (iii) σ is UNknown.</li>
<li>An observational study with randomly selected subjects was used.</li>
<li>The σ is unknown and n=32&amp;ge15 and the sample distribution is not strongly skewed as suggested by the mean and median being approximately equal (Note that I would have preferred to have a histogram to look at).</li>
<li>The statistic is x̄ = 83.2.</li>
<li>The test statistic is t=<span class="math inline">\(\frac{83.2-80}{\frac{5.5}{\sqrt{32}}}\)</span> = 3.291 with 32-1 = 31 df.</li>
<li>The p-value is 0.0012.</li>
<li>The H<sub>0</sub> is rejected because the p-value &lt; α.</li>
<li>It appears that the mean achievement score of all students at the superintendent’s school is greater than 80 points.</li>
<li>One is 95% confident that the mean achievement score for all students at the superintendent’s school is greater than 83.2-1.696 <span class="math inline">\(\frac{5.5}{\sqrt{32}}\)</span>=81.46 points, which further supports that the mean achievement score is greater than 80.</li>

<li>H<sub>0</sub> μ = 32, H<sub>A</sub> μ &gt; 32 where μ is the mean salary in 1000s of dollars.</li>
<li>A one-sample t-test is required because (i) a quantitative variable (salary) was measured, (ii) individuals are from one group/population (Northwestern University), and (iii) σ is UNknown.</li>
<li>An observational study with apparent random selection of individuals (background says “random surveys”) was used.</li>
<li>The σ is unknown and n=42≥40; thus, the sampling distribution of the test statistic should follow a t-distribution.</li>

<li>A one-sample t-test is required because (i) a quantitative variable (breaking weight) was measured, (ii) individuals are from one group/population (one type of line), and (iii) σ is UNknown.</li>
<li>An experimental study with randomly selected pieces of line was used.</li>
<li>The σ is unknown. The sample size (=20)≥15 and the histogram suggests that the sample distribution is roughly symmetric (Figure 1). Thus, the assumptions are adequately met and the sampling distribution of the test statistic should follow a t-distribution.</li>

<li>It does not appear that the line breaks at average pressures less than 6 lbs; the manufacturer’s claim is supported.</li>
<li>One is 90% confident that the average pressure that the line breaks is less than 6.06lbs, which further supports that the average pressure to break the line is not less than 6 lbs (Table 1).</li>
