The H<sub>A</sub>:μ<sub>L</sub>-μ<sub>UL</sub>&lt;0 (representing that the lined cartons will reduce the dioxin level).</li>
<li>A two-sample t-test is required because quantitative variable (dioxin level) was measured on two groups/populations (cartons with and without foil) that were INdependent (the lined and unlined cartons are not connected at all) and two population means are being compared in the null hypothesis.</li>
<li>The data appear to be part of an observational study; however there is no mention of randomization in this study although it would have been easy to randomly select cartons.</li>
<li>The individuals in the two groups are independent (cartons could not be both linead and unlined). The sample size (n<sub>L</sub>+n<sub>UL</sub>=100) is ≥ 40. Therefore, the test statistic computed below should reasonably follow a t-distribution with n<sub>L</sub>+n<sub>UL</sub>-2 = 98 df.

Histograms constructed for both groups (Figure 1) suggested a right-skewness but not an overly strong skew (this is very difficult to ascertain because of the small sample size). Therefore, the test statistic computed below should reasonably follow a t-distribution with n<sub>1</sub>+n<sub>2</sub>-2 = 29-2 = 27 df.
