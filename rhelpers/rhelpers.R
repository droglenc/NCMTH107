# Creates (if need2render=TRUE) and modifies the created HTML
#   file to better utilize GitHub's abilities.
# Modifications are ...
# 1. Remove a bunch of header stuff from the HTML file and
#    replace it with the YAML header in the Rmd file.
# 2. Remove the hard-wired RStudio ordered lists so that the
#    the first level will be numbers (the GitHub) default and
#    the second level will be letters (as per the CSS line
#    at the bottom of each Rmd file).
# Note that for some reason, some Rmd files need to be
#   rendered with the Knit HTML button in RStudio.  In these
#   cases, do that and then use need2render=FALSE in this
#   function.
