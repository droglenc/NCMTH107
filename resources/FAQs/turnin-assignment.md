subtitle: How do I "turn-in" my "module assignments"?

Each [module](../../modules/) of material has one (sometimes two) assignments that will be due by 8am the day after the class period dedicated to that module. The assignment is listed under the "Practice" section on the module webpage (see ["Foundational Definitions"](../../modules/FoundationalDefns){:target="_blank"} as an example). Assignments can be typed or (neatly) hand-written and will ultimately need to be turned into a PDF document for online submission to [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/144614){:target="_blank"}. [The first two pages of these directions](https://gradescope-static-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/help/submitting_hw_guide.pdf){:target="_blank"} show how to use your device to scan hand-written work to a PDF. [The last page of those directions](https://gradescope-static-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/help/submitting_hw_guide.pdf){:target="_blank"} shows how to upload your PDF to Gradescope and identify the page on which each answer appears (this is required). The assignment on Gradescope will have the module name and "-- assignment" suffix. Graded assignments will be returned to your Northland e-mail and detailed answer keys will be placed on the module webpage.

Much of the work for these assignments will be completed during our class periods, though you may need to finish some parts outside of class.

As noted on the [syllabus](../Syllabus-Current#grading), these assignments are worth an important part of your overall grade.
