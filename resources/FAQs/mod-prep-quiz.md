As noted in the [syllabus](../Syllabus-Current#course-workflow) this course is taught in a "flipped format." One of the things that this means for you is that you will "prepare" for the material on a particular [module](../modules/) **BEFORE** the class period dedicated to that module. To aid your preparation, I have created "preparation questions" for each module that will guide your preparation for that module's material. These questions are below the "Preparation for Class" heading on each module webpage (see ["Foundational Definitions"](../modules/FoundationalDefns){:target="_blank"} as an example). Prior to the class period dedicated to a module (see the [Dates page](Dates-Current.html)) you will use written and video materials to answer the preparation questions.

Each module will have a "module preparation quiz" that will be available on the [class Gradescope page](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/144614){:target="_blank"} (these quizzes will be named after the module and will include the "-- Prep Check" suffix). Between 1pm on the day before and 8am on the day of the class period dedicated to a module, you should complete and submit the corresponding "module preparation quiz." While taking this quiz you may refer to your notes, the readings, or the videos. Graded quizzes will be returned to your Northland e-mail.

As noted on the [syllabus](../Syllabus-Current#grading), these "quizzes" are worth an important part of your overall grade.
