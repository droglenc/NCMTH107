R/RStudio (unless you have changed it) uses the monospaced Courier font to display output.  However, the font used in R is not maintained when the R/RStudio results are pasted into MSWord.  Thus, the results do not vertically align in MSWord as they did in R/RStudio.  The following steps may be used to return to using the Courier font for the results.

1. In MSWord, select the text pasted from R.
1. Right-click on the text you selected and select the *Font* item.
1. In the ensuing dialog box, select (scroll down to) *Courier New* or *Courier* in the selection box under *Font*.
1. Press *OK*.

The Courier font can sometimes be "too big" such that the results will wrap to another line.  You can address this problem by either reducing the font size or widening the margins of the document.  To choose a smaller font size

1. In MSWord, select the text pasted from R.
1. Right-click on the text you selected and select the *Font* item.
1. In the ensuing dialog box, select a smaller number in the *Size* chooser.
1. Press *OK*.

To widen the margins

1. Select the *PAGE LAYOUT* tab (in the MSWord menu bar).
1. Select the *Margins* item (far left on the MSWord ribbon).
1. Select either *Moderate*, *Narrow*, or *Custom Margins*.
