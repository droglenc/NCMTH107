This error usually occurs for one of three reasons described in the sections below.

## Typo

Most of the time this error occurs because you typed the name of the function incorrectly (notice mispelling of `library()`).
```{r error=TRUE}
libary(NCStats)
```


## NCStats is not Loaded

If the problem is not a typo, then this error typically occurs because you do not have a required package loaded.  More often than not in this class that means that you did not load `NCStats` with ...
```{r eval=FALSE}
library(NCStats)
```

If `NCStats` is not installed on your computer then see [this FAQ.](install-NCStats.html)

## Other Package is not Loaded

Some functions used in this course are contained in other packages, most of which are loaded when `NCStats` is loaded.  However, some of these functions will required that the other package be installed and loaded.  Installation of these packages [in this FAQ](install-other-packages.html).  Packages are loaded with `library()` as demonstrated above for `NCStats`.
