**Homework assignments should be single-spaced** ([see expectations for homework here](../../hwformat)), but MSWord does not default to single-spacing.  To single-space a document,

1. Select all text in your document (or a single paragraph).
1. Right-click on the text you selected and select the *Paragraph* item.
1. About half-way down in the ensuing dialog box is a section labeled *Spacing*.  In that section, change the item in the drop-down box under *Line spacing* to *Single*.
1. Press *OK*.

Also see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBWm3oJ3b4k){:target="_blank"} for how to make this setting permanent.
