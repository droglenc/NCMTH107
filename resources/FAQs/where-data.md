Many times I will refer to data files that I have made available to you or a file name with a ".csv" extension will be mentioned.  These files are available from [this page](../../data_107). [This R Tutorial video](https://vimeo.com/user45324800/ncstats-preparedatawebpage) describes how to download these data and [this R Tutorial video](https://vimeo.com/user45324800/ncstats-loadcsvrstudio) describes hos to load these data into RStudio.

For some computers and browsers, the CSV file will not download properly. A method to correct this problem is [described here](fix-CSV-download).
