Typical results from a `t.test()` (two-sample t-test in this example) look like this.
```{r}
t.test(extra~group,data=sleep,var.equal=TRUE)
```

We would not reject the null hypothesis with these results if $\alpha=0.05$ was being used (note `r kPvalue(t.test(extra~group,data=sleep,var.equal=TRUE)$p.value)`>$\alpha$).  However, some students mistakenly interpret the third line of output as saying that the alternative hypothesis is true (and thus the null hypothesis is rejected).  R does NOT make the rejection decision for you.  The third line of output is simply a reminder of what you set the alternative hypothesis to in `alt=` of `t.test()` (note that the default is `alt="two.sided"` or "not equals").  You must decide to reject or not to reject the null hypothesis by comparing the p-value reported in the second line of output to the $\alpha$ that you have chosen to use.
