This error typically looks like this ...
```{r error=TRUE}
df <- read.csv("no-header.csv")
```

The most common reasons for this error are as follows

* You have misspelled the actual name of the file.
* You have not changed the working directory to where the data file is saved.  See [this FAQ](changing-working-directory) on how to change the working directory.  Make sure you change the working directory to where your file is actually saved.
* You have not saved the file as a CSV file.  Most commonly you saved it as an Excel file.  Saving an Excel file as a CSV file is described in [this R Tutorial video](https://vimeo.com/user45324800/ncstats-preparedataexcel).
