subtitle: Why can't read.csv() find my data file?
author: Derek H. Ogle

<hr />
<p>This error typically looks like this â€¦</p>
<pre class="r"><code>&gt; df &lt;- read.csv(&quot;no-header.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>Warning in file(file, &quot;rt&quot;): cannot open file 'no-header.csv': No such file or directory</code></pre>
<pre><code>Error in file(file, &quot;rt&quot;): cannot open the connection</code></pre>
<p>The most common reasons for this error are as follows</p>
<ul>
<li>You have misspelled the actual name of the file.</li>
<li>You have not changed the working directory to where the data file is saved. See <a href="changing-working-directory">this FAQ</a> on how to change the working directory. Make sure you change the working directory to where your file is actually saved.</li>
<li>You have not saved the file as a CSV file. Most commonly you saved it as an Excel file. Saving an Excel file as a CSV file is described in <a href="https://vimeo.com/user45324800/ncstats-preparedataexcel">this R Tutorial video</a>.</li>
