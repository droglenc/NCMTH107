subtitle: How do I make Greek symbols in MSWord?
---

In homework assignments you may want to represent key statistical concepts with Greek letters.  Greek letters can be constructed in MSWord by changing the font of a specific Roman letter to *Symbol*.  To change the font type

1. Select the specific letter.
1. Right-click on the text you selected and select the *Font* item.
1. In the ensuing dialog box, select (scroll down to) *Symbol* in the selection box under *Font*.
1. Press *OK*.

The relationship between the specific Roman letters (what you initially type) and the corresponding Greek letter (what you will see with the Symbol font) are shown below.

Roman Letter | Greek Letter
------------ | ------------
a | &alpha;
b | &beta;
m | &mu;
s | &sigma;
X | &chi;
` | &oline;
