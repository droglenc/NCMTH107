## Setting-up Teams

* Open up your webmail from [my.northland.edu](https://my.northland.edu/){:target="_blank"} (link at the very bottom of the page or [use this](https://my.northland.edu/web-mail/){:target="_blank"}). Select "Go" after "Student email >".
* In the ensuing page select the "Teams" icon.

* You will be asked to install the app. If you are using your own computer you may want to do this for simplicity. Note that you may need to set the security options on your computer to allow the app to access your computer's camera.
* With the app or the web-based verson you will need to answer some simple configuration questions.

If you did not set-up the Teams app and are running Teams through the web interface then you will need to use the Chrome or Edge browsers to make a video call (Teams does not support Internet Explorer, Firefox, or Safari for making video calls).
