subtitle: How do I ask questions on the Piazza discussion site?

You can of course ask question directly of me during class. You can also ask question of me outside of class during office hours or via e-mail. However, for questions outside of class I prefer that you ask them on the class Piazza discussion site (a link can be found on the [resources page](../) and [syllabus](../../syllabus#assistance)). I prefer that you use the Piazza site for two reasons. First, I cannot monitor my e-mail at all times but other students in the class may see your question and be able to answer it. Second, other students in the class may (likely do) have the same question as you and will benefit from seeing the answer (either from me or other students).

Posting a question on Piazza is simple ... you can [follow these directions](https://support.piazza.com/support/solutions/articles/48000574396-students-post-a-question){:target="_blank"}. Note that you can post your question anonymously to other students (they won't know you asked it) but not to me (I will know that you asked it). Also think of the following suggestions when choosing a folder in which to post your question.

* *logistics* -- choose this when asking a question related to the administration of the course. Questions like when something is due, where to find the Frequently Asked Questions page, etc. should be posted here.
* *assignments* -- choose this when asking a question about module assignments.
* *prep_checks* -- choose this when asking a question about module preparation questions or module preparation quizzes.
* *final_exam* -- choose this when asking a question about the final exam.
* *other* -- choose this for other questions.
