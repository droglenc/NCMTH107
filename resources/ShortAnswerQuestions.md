1. What are the two major goals of statistics? Define any statistical jargon in your answer!
1. What are the two types of variability? Specifically define each.
1. What are three “realities” that, if they did not exist, would eliminate the need for the field of statistics?
1. Explain what major goal of statistics is related to how a parameter is related to a population and how a statistic is related to a sample.
1. Describe natural and sampling variability within the context of a “real-life” (or realistic) situation of interest to you. Clearly describe the situation (e.g., “Consider the situation where ...”) and then specifically define the two types of variability within the context of that situation (e.g., “Within this situation, natural variability is when XXX and sampling variability is when XXX”).
1. Describe the two major differences between an experiment and an observational study?
1. Describe the three major principles of experimental design and why each is important.
1. What are two advantages of an experiment that simultaneously manipulates two factors as compared to two separate experiments that each manipulate only one factor?
1. What are three reasons why an observational study is important, even though cause-and-effect statements cannot be made from one?
1. What is the difference between a “forward” and a “reverse” normal distribution question?
1. What are the two major goals of linear regression?
1. Define RSS and explain how it is used to find the “best-fit line.”
1. What are the two assumptions of linear regression that will be focused on in this course? Sketch scatterplots that show when each of the two assumptions of linear regression are and are not violated.
1. Completely describe three major differences between a population distribution and a sampling distribution.
1. Explicitly state what the Central Limit Theorem tells us.
1. Describe each step of the scientific method.
1. What is the definition of a p-value and how is it used to make a decision about H<sub>0</sub>?
1. Describe choices that you, as a researcher, can make to decrease the probability of making a Type II error. Which is the best choice to make (statistically) and why?
1. Describe choices that you, as a researcher, can make to increase power. Which is the best choice to make (statistically) and why?
1. Describe choices that you, as a researcher, can make to reduce the margin-of-error. Which is the best choice to make (statistically) and why?
1. Describe choices that you, as a researcher, can make to make a narrower confidence interval. Which is the best choice to make (statistically) and why?
1. Specifically describe how you would choose between performing a 1-sample Z-test, 1-sample t-test, 2-sample t-test, chi-square test, and a goodness-of-fit test.
1. Describe the importance of statistics (as a field of study or a collection of methods). Make sure you DESCRIBE the two major goals of statistics, at least three major concepts or ideas of statistics, and how methods that you learned this semester illustrate or are related to why you think statistics is important. [*An answer with less than 400 thoughtful words is probably inadequate.*]
