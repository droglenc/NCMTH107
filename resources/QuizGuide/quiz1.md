The first Quiz (see [dates page](../Dates-Current)) will cover material from Module 1 (*Why Statistics Is Important*), Module 2 (*Foundational Definitions*), Module 3 (*Data Production*), Module 5 (*Univariate EDA - Categorical*), Module 6 (*Summaries for One Quantitative Variable*), and Module 7 (*Univariate EDA - Quantitative*). There will be **no** questions regarding R or that will use R. Any material in the module readings and videos (specifically questions on the preparation guides), exercises, additional exercises, or review exercises may be on the quiz.

* [**5%**] Five multiple choice questions. These are primarily definitions or symbols.
* [**16%**] Four short answer (2-4 sentences) questions (see [this resource](../ShortAnswerQuestions)).
* [**8%**] Identify types of variables ... [like this](../../modules/CE/FoundationalDefns_CE1.html#types-of-variables-i) in Module 2 (*Foundational Definitions*).
* [**12%**] Perform an IVPPSS analysis ... [like this](../../modules/CE/FoundationalDefns_CE1.html#sustainability-survey) (and many others in the exercises and review exercises) in Module 2 (*Foundational Definitions*).
* [**6%**] Determine if a situation represents an experiment or an observational study ... [like this](../../modules/CE/DataProduction_CE1.html#study-types-i) and [this](../../modules/CE/DataProduction_CE2.html#study-types-ii) in Module 3 (*Data Production*).
* [**4%**] Determine the type of observational study ... [like this](../../modules/CE/../../modules/CE/DataProduction_CE1.html#types-of-observational-studies-i) and [this](../../modules/CE/../../modules/CE/DataProduction_CE2.html#types-of-observational-studies-ii) in Module 3 (*Data Production*).
* [**4%**] Identify the response and explanatory variables ... [like this](../../modules/CE/../../modules/CE/DataProduction_CE1.html#identify-response-and-explanatory-variables-i) and [this](../../modules/CE/../../modules/CE/DataProduction_CE2.html#identify-response-and-explanatory-variables-ii) in Module 3 (*Data Production*).
* [**9%**] Identify key components of an experiment ... [like this](../../modules/CE/../../modules/CE/DataProduction_CE1.html#blood-pressure-study) (and many others in the exercises and review exercises) in Module 3 (*Data Production*).
* [**11%**] Compute the mean and standard deviation for 4-6 numbers ... [like this](../../modules/CE/UEDAQuant1_CE1.html#hand-calculations) in Module 6 (*Summaries for One Quantitative Variable*). You can practice more of these by choosing your own numbers and using `sdCalc()` as described in [this exercise](../..//modules/CE/UEDAQuant1_CE1#hints) to check your answers.
* [**11%**] Compute the median and IQR for 12-20 numbers ... [like this](../../modules/CE/UEDAQuant1_CE1.html#hand-calculations) in Module 6 (*Summaries for One Quantitative Variale*). You can practice more of these by choosing your own numbers and using `iqrCalc()` as described in [this exercise](../..//modules/CE/UEDAQuant1_CE1#hints) to check your answers.
* [**4%**] Perform a univariate EDA for a categorical variable from a provided bar chart, frequency table, or percentages table ... [like question 5 on this](../../modules/CE/UEDACat_CE1.html#bar-chart-i) or [this](../../modules/CE/UEDACat_CE2.html#bar-chart-ii) (but focus on writing a summary) in Module 5 (*Univariate EDA - Categorical*).
* [**10%**] Perform a univariate EDA for a quantitative variable from a provided histogram and table of summary statistics ... [like this](../../modules/CE/UEDAQuant2_CE1.html#commute-times) (and many others in the exercises and review exercises) in Module 7 (*Univariate EDA - Quantitative*).

The quiz is closed book, closed notes, etc. **You WILL need a calculator** (you may NOT use the calculator on your phone or the computer) and **you MUST use a pencil** (quizzes written in red ink will not be accepted and will earn a zero). The quiz will begin promptly at 0800 for the first section and 1000 for the second section and must be completed within 1 hour and 50 minutes. Please take care of your personal needs before the quiz so that you do not need to leave the classroom during the quiz (if, for some reason, you do need to leave the classroom, make sure to leave your phone and other devices in the room and let me know that you are leaving the room; failing to do so will earn a zero).

The best way to prepare for this quiz is by ...

1. Reviewing your work on the module exercises. Carefully compare your answers to the answer keys available on each module page, paying close attention to the "notes" in yellow boxes.
1. Practice more exercises, either in the "more as time permits" links or in the review exercises (many of these are old test questions) for all modules. Focus on questions that are similar to those linked to above.
1. Study your module preparation guide notes carefully. Augment them by rereading portions of the reading where your notes are poor.
1. Start practicing early so that if you have questions you can get help from me or from [the tutors](../Syllabus-Current.html#tutors).

Please let me know if you have any questions about this quiz.
