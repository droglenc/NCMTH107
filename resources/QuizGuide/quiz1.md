The first Quiz (see [dates page](../Dates-Current)) will cover material from Module 1 (*Why Statistics Is Important*), Module 2 (*Foundational Definitions*), Module 3 (*Data Production*), Module 6 (*Summaries for One Quantitative Variable*), and Module 7 (*Univariate EDA - Quantitative*). The quiz is primarily application questions but several short answer essay questions will also be asked. There will be **no** questions regarding R or that will use R. Any material in the module readings and videos (specifically questions on the preparation guides), exercises (most completed in class), or review exercises may be on the quiz.

* [**23%**] Five short answer essay (2-4 sentences) questions. Three of these are from Module 1 (*Why Statistics Is Important*), one is from Module 2 (*Foundational Definitions*), and one is from Module 3 (*Data Production*). All of these questions were either part of the exercises or on a module preparation guide. I also hinted pretty strongly in class what several of these questions would be.
* [**8%**] Identify the type of variable ... [like this](../../modules/CE/FoundationalDefns_CE.html#types-of-variables-i) in Module 2 (*Foundational Definitions*).
* [**12%**] Perform an IVPPSS analysis ... [like this](../../modules/CE/FoundationalDefns_CE.html#sustainability-survey) (and many others in the exercises and review exercises) in Module 2 (*Foundational Definitions*).
* [**6%**] Determine if a situation represents an experiment or an observational study ... [like this](../../modules/CE/DataProduction_CE1.html#study-types-i) in Module 3 (*Data Production*).
* [**4%**] Determine the type of observational study ... [like this](../../modules/CE/../../modules/CE/DataProduction_CE1.html#types-of-observational-studies-i) in Module 3 (*Data Production*).
* [**4%**] Identify the response and explanatory variables ... [like this](../../modules/CE/../../modules/CE/DataProduction_CE1.html#identify-response-and-explanatory-variables-i) in Module 3 (*Data Production*).
* [**9%**] Identify key components of an experiment ... [like this](../../modules/CE/../../modules/CE/DataProduction_CE1.html#blood-pressure-study) (and many others in the exercises and review exercises) in Module 3 (*Data Production*).
* [**12%**] Compute the mean and standard deviation for 4-6 numbers ... [like this](../../modules/CE/UEDAQuant1_CE1.html#hand-calculations) in Module 5 (*Summaries for One Quantitative Variable*). You can practice more of these by choosing your own numbers and using `sdCalc()` as described in the exercises to check your answers.
* [**12%**] Compute the median and IQR for 12-20 numbers ... [like this](../../modules/CE/UEDAQuant1_CE1.html#hand-calculations) in Module 5 (*Summaries for One Quantitative Variale*). You can practice more of these by choosing your own numbers and using `iqrCalc()` as described in the exercises to check your answers.
* [**10%**] Perform a univariate EDA for a quantitative variable from a provided histogram and table of summary statistics ... [like this](../../modules/CE/UEDAQuant2_CE1.html#commute-times) (and many others in the exercises and review exercises) in Module 6 (*Univariate EDA - Quantitative*).

I strongly believe that the best way to prepare for this quiz is by ...

1. Reviewing what you did on the class exercises. I would carefully compare your answers to the answer keys that are available on each module page. Also pay close attention to the "notes" that I have placed in yellow boxes in the answer keys.
1. Practice more exercises, either in the "more as time permits" links for some modules or in the review exercises (many of these are old test questions) for all modules. Focus on questions that are similar to the ones linked to in the list above.
1. Study your module preparation guide notes carefully. Augment them by rereading portions of the reading where your notes are poor.
1. Start practicing early so that if you have questions you can get help from me or from [the tutors](../Syllabus-Current.html#tutors) (who have tutor hours on the Monday, Tuesday, and the Thursday before the quiz).

The quiz is closed book, closed notes, etc. **You should bring a calculator and you MUST use a pencil**. Quizzes written in red ink will not be accepted and will earn a zero. The quiz will begin promptly at 0800 for the first section and 1000 for the second section and must be turned in with 1 hour and 50 minutes. Please take care of your personal needs before the quiz so that you do not need to leave the classroom during the quiz (if, for some reason, you do need to leave the classroom, make sure to leave your phone and other devices in the room and let me know that you are leaving the room).

Please let me know if you have any questions about this quiz.
