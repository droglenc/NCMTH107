## Description

Introduction to the concepts and interpretation of statistics.  Summary graphs and statistics; data production (sampling and experiments); random variables and sampling distributions; inference - introduction, for distributions, for proportions; correlation and regression.  Prerequisite: MTH103, ACT math > 17, or SAT math > 470.  4 Credits.

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of this class you will be able to ...

1. describe why statistics is central to scientific inquiry (& your field of interest); 
1. define basic statistical words and symbols; 
1. design simple experiments and sampling strategies; 
1. perform appropriate exploratory data analyses (univariate and bivariate); 
1. identify the purposes of and conduct and interpret the results of a linear regression; 
1. construct and interpret confidence intervals for one and two-sample mean and proportion problems;
1. identify the appropriate hypothesis test to perform in one- and two-sample quantitative and categorical data situations; 
1. construct and interpret the results from a hypothesis test for one- and two-sample quantitative and categorical data situations; and 
1. communicate statistical results and ideas in a succinct and informative manner. 

We will focus on the understanding of statistical concepts and proper interpretation of statistical results.

## Grading

An overall percentage score will be computed from the items and associated weights listed in the table below.  A specific description for each item is given further below.  You can also use this table to compute your current or projected future grade.  To compute your current grade, enter your percentage scores in the boxes for assessments that have been completed.  To project your future grade, also include percentages for future assessments.  [*It is your responsibility to track your scores on the individual assessments.*]

<!-- if the assessment weights change then you must change the values in get_wghts() in the grader.js file -->

### Quizzes

A short quiz will be given in the **FIRST 5-10 minutes of EVERY** class period.  These quizzes are intended to encourage you to complete the preparation required for that day's class.  Thus, quizzes are "open notes" (but **not** "open book" or "open computer").  You will be notified at the end of each class period about what portion of the text and online resources are required to prepare for the next class period.  Quizzes that are missed for reasons that have not been approved by me cannot be made up.

### Homework

The text contains many review exercises throughout each chapter and a few homework problems at the end of each chapter.  Homework problems will be assigned when a concept module has been completed.  Homework problems will be handed in but will only be graded for completeness (i.e., checking whether the questions have been completely answered or not).  Answer keys will be [posted online](homework-keys) so that you may check your work.

### Exams

Exam dates are shown on the [Due Dates page](calendar.html){:target="_blank"}.  Make-up exams will be provided only if you have a fixed commitment of sufficient importance that was set before the beginning of the semester or a verifiable medical condition.  You will not be allowed to make up an exam missed without my prior approval.  The final exam will not be given early.

### "Statistics in Use" Reports

Three typed reports about the use of statistics in your everyday life.  Information for these reports may come from the use of statistics in the news, in your other classes, or other work that you have done.

If you report on a news item, then you should discuss the background of the information in the report, the use of statistics, how the statistics relate to what you have learned in class, how the statistics were presented, how you feel about that presentation, and any questions that you may have.  The FOCUS of your report should be on the statistics used in the news item (not just the news item).  You may not use the same type of news item for more than one report (e.g., you cannot report on presidential race polls more than once).

If you report on statistics used in another class, then you should discuss the background of the project where you used statistics, what the statistics were used for (i.e., purpose), a presentation of your statistical work in the report (i.e., findings), how the statistics relate to what you've learned in this class, and any questions that you may have.  Again, the FOCUS should be on the statistics that you used.

### Project

See the [Class Project page](project.html).

### Extra Credit

Extra credit may be obtained by completing a two-part typed reflection on each midterm exam.  The two parts are as follows:

* **Correction**: Correct answers for each question you missed along with *an explanation of why the answer you originally provided was not correct and why the correct answer is correct.*  You will receive no credit for simply correcting your answer, for providing another incorrect answer, or saying "*I have no idea why I put that answer*," "*I simply wrote the wrong answer*," "*I don't know what I was thinking,*" or any other nonsensical reason.  You must address every question you missed to receive full credit for this portion.  Your answers must be typed and easy to find (i.e., neatly organized by question number) and you *must include the original exam*.  This portion is worth 2/3rd of the overall value of the exam reflection.
* **Reflection**: Your *thoughtful* reflections about the exam, including what you did well on the exam (and why), what you did not do so well on the exam (and why), what strategy you used to prepare for the exam, how you will change your strategy to prepare for the next exam, and whether you considered the exam to be fair or not.  This portion should be at least one page but not more than two pages and is worth 1/3rd of the overall value of the exam reflection.

A perfect exam reflection will add 10% to your final exam score (but the final score cannot be greater than 100%).

### Incomplete Grades

Under Northland College policy, an incomplete grade will be given ONLY under extreme circumstances beyond your control, such as a major illness.  An incomplete grade will be given ONLY if you have successfully completed the entire course except for the final exam.


## Participation and Conduct

This course is taught in the framework of active-learning, peer-instruction, and inquiry-based pedagogies.  This means that you will be asked to prepare for the class period, answer questions based on your reading, work in small groups with others, and participate in small- and large-group discussions.  Your participation in these activities is critical to your learning and success in this course, but also to the overall success of the course.

<img class="img-right" src="../img/studying.jpg">

As a general rule-of-thumb ([here](http://www.collegeparents.org/members/resources/articles/your-college-student-investing-enough-time-studying){:target="_blank"}, [here](http://classroom.synonym.com/ratio-studying-class-time-college-1075.html){:target="_blank"}, [here](https://www.usu.edu/asc/idea_sheets/pdf/estimate_study_hours.pdf){:target="_blank"}, and [here](http://collegelife.about.com/od/academiclife/f/How-Much-Time-Should-I-Spend-Studying-In-College.htm){:target="_blank"}, among many), students are expected to spend between 2-3 hours of time outside of class for each hour in class.  This course meets for 4.5 hours per week and, thus, we expect between 9 and 13.5 hours of time outside of class will be dedicated to preparing for class, completing homework and other assessments, and studying for exams.  We fully believe that the work required for this course can be completed within this expected amount of time, **if that time is quality-time** (i.e., without distraction).

If you feel that you are spending an inordinate amount of time on some assignments because you are "stuck," then start your assignments early so that you can stop (and do other things) and make plans to see the [tutors](#tutors) or [instructor](#instructor) for help.

Your conduct in class should revolve around the idea of being respectful of all others in the class.  Adhering to the following policies should be considered the minimum requirements to being respectful of others:

* Arrive to class on time.  If you arrive late, then take the first available seat as quietly as possible.
* Do not bring friends, children, pets, meals, or anything else to class that should not be there.
* Turn off and store out-of-sight cell phones and other electronic devices (use of a personal laptop for work related to class is permitted).
* Do not use the college or personal computers for other than assigned tasks.
* Do not engage in side discussions while I or others are speaking to the entire class.
* Do not use disrespectful language when addressing others.

You will be asked to leave class if your behavior is disrespectful of others.
