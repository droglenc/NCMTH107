## Assistance

> Don't be afraid to ask questions. Don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it. I do that every day. Asking for help isn't a sign of weakness, its a sign of strength. It shows you have the courage to admit when you don't know something, and to learn something new. -- President Barack Obama

### Instructor -- Derek Ogle

### Accommodations
I want to create an inclusive and accessible learning environment for those of you that have a condition (e.g., attention, learning, vision, hearing, mental, physical, or other health-related concern) that may require special accommodations. *If you have already established accommodations* with the Office of Accessibility Resources (OAR), please communicate your approved accommodations to me as soon as possible so that we can discuss your needs in this course. If you have a condition that requires accommodations but *you have not yet established services* through OAR, then you should contact Jennifer Newago as soon as possible (Ponzio 230, x1387, or <a href="mailto:accommodations@northland.edu">accommodations@northland.edu</a>). It is the policy and practice of Northland College to create inclusive and accessible learning environments consistent with federal and state law. <a href="https://my.northland.edu/life/be-healthy/accommodations/">More information is available here.</a>


### Academic Alerts
If I observe you "struggling" with the course early in the semester then I may file an "Academic Alert" about you. If this happens, you will receive an e-mail from me that will suggest steps you can take to improve your performance in the course. Our Academic Success Coordinator, Megan McPeak, will receive the alert and will likely also reach out to you. **Academic Alerts are not punitive**, they are simply an attempt to help you get back on track in this course as soon as possible.

## Course Workflow
<img class="img-right" src="../img/StudyOnline.jpg" alt="Decoration">
The course is scheduled to meet every weekday from 8-1130am. However, because of physical distancing guidelines, half of you will meet in the classroom from 815-945am and the other half will meet from 10-1130am. Which groups will meet during which period will alternate weekly.

This course is taught in a "flipped format", which loosely means that you will be responsible for obtaining factual content prior to coming to class and will then use class time with me to apply and expand upon what you learned prior to class. I have taught this class in this format for five years, largely because I believe the science that indicates that deeper learning is achieved with this model. However, this format also allows for teaching face-to-face, on-line, or a hybrid of both as necessary.

The course is composed of [25 modules](../modules/index) of material which roughly corresponds to one module per day. Below describes a general format of instruction that you should follow for each module.

1. **Prepare Module Material** -- Each module has questions that will guide your preparation for that module's material. These questions are below the "Preparation for Class" heading on each module webpage (see ["Foundational Definitions"](../modules/FoundationalDefns){:target="_blank"} as an example). Prior to the class period dedicated to a module (see the [Dates page](Dates-Current.html)) you will use written and video materials to answer the preparation questions. Additionally you may ask relevant questions about the material on the [Piazza discussion site](https://piazza.com/northland/fall2020/mth107){:target="_blank"}.
1. **Complete Module Preparation Quiz** -- Each module will have a "module preparation quiz" that will be available on the [class Gradescope page](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/144614){:target="_blank"} (these quizzes will be named after the module and will include the "-- Prep Check" suffix). Between 1pm on the day before and 8am on the day of the class period dedicated to a module, you should complete and submit the corresponding "module preparation quiz." While taking this quiz you may refer to your notes, the readings, or the videos. Graded quizzes will be returned to your Northland e-mail.
1. **Class Time** -- Class time will generally consist of short reviews of the module material, simulations related to core concepts, and work on application exercises. You are expected to attend class according to college policy as this will be a time to get direct help from me. During many class periods you will start and likely finish most of a required assignment.
1. **Complete an Applied Assignment** -- Each module has an assignment where you will demonstrate that you can apply the module's concepts. The assignment is listed under the "Practice" section on the module webpage (see ["Foundational Definitions"](../modules/FoundationalDefns){:target="_blank"} as an example). Assignments can be typed or (neatly) hand-written and will ultimately need to be turned into a PDF document for online submission to [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/144614){:target="_blank"}. [The first two pages of these directions](https://gradescope-static-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/help/submitting_hw_guide.pdf){:target="_blank"} show how to use your device to scan hand-written work to a PDF. [The last page of those directions](https://gradescope-static-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/help/submitting_hw_guide.pdf){:target="_blank"} shows how to upload your PDF to Gradescope and identify the page on which each answer appears (this is required). The assignment on Gradescope will have the module name and "-- assignment" suffix and are due by 8am on the day after the class period dedicated to the module. Graded assignments will be returned to your Northland e-mail and detailed answer keys will be placed on the module webpage.

## Grading
<img class="img-right" src="../img/grading.jpg">
An overall grade will be computed from the module preparation quizzes and assignments described  in the ["Course Workflow" section](#course-workflow) and a final exam. Module preparation quizzes and assignments not submitted by the due date time will not be accepted. However, your lowest three quiz and assignment grades will be dropped when computing your overall grade. The final exam is an opportunity for you to show a synthetic understanding of all material from throughout the course. The final exam will be focused on larger concepts, applications, and interpretations (rather than specific details) from throughout the semester. I will provide you with an explicit study guide approximately one week before the final exam.

An overall score will be computed from the items and associated weights listed in the table below. To compute your current grade, enter your percentage scores in the boxes for completed assessments. Grades on individual module preparation quizzes and assignments can be found on the [class Gradescope page](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/144614){:target="_blank"}. To project your future grade, also include percentages for future assessments.

<!-- if the assessment weights change then you must change the values in get_wghts() in the grader.js file -->

  <tr><td>D+ 67-69</td><td>D  60-66</td><td>F   0-59</td></tr>
</table>

#### Incomplete Grades
An incomplete grade will be given ONLY in extreme circumstances that are beyond your control, such as a major illness, and will ONLY be given if you have successfully completed the entire course except for the final exam. This is in accordance with [Northland College policy](https://my.northland.edu/student-policies/academic-policies/#grades){:target="_blank"} (scroll down to "Incomplete Grades").

#### Midterm Grades
I will submit a "midterm grade" for you approximately half-way through the semester. This grade will by my best guess at your lowest possible final grade. I assign this "worst-case" midterm grade because I believe that it is better to know the worst rather than the best-case scenario at that point of the semester and the material at the end of the semester is a little more difficult than the material at the beginning of the semester. Of course, see me if you have questions about your midterm grade.

## Expectations

### Ownership of Learning
<img class="img-right" src="../img/student-reflection-and-ownership_orig.png" alt="Decoration">
This course is designed in a way that you will have to actively, rather than passively, engage in the course content. In this way, it may differ from some of your other courses. In particular, in this course you will need to:

* Interact with the course material **daily**.
* Multi-task material from multiple modules (i.e., you may be finishing the assignment for one module while preparing for the next module).
* Prepare for some course content on your own prior to class.
* Use class and the Piazza discussion site to ask questions and seek help.
* Assess your own performance by reviewing your graded work an comparing your answers on assignments to the answer key (which will also contain hints related to common mistakes).
* Assess if you need more practice and complete additional exercises provided for most modules.
* Ask for help from me (the professor) both during and outside of class. See [Assistance](#assistance) section above.
* Maintain focus for an extended period of time (1.5 h for each class).

### Work Outside of Class
<img class="img-right" src="../img/studying.jpg" alt="Decoration">
As a general rule-of-thumb[^studytime], you are expected to spend 2-3 hours of time outside of class for each hour in class. For this course, you will meet for 7.5 hours per week and, thus, you should dedicate between 15 and 22.5 hours of time outside of class time preparing for class, completing assignments, reviewing your work, and asking questions or for help. **The work required for this course can be completed within this expected amount of time, if that time is without distraction**. If monitoring your phone/device is distracting you from getting your work done then you may consider the aid of apps (e.g., [Forest](https://www.forestapp.cc/)) designed to reduce distractions from devices.[^DistractionAids]  

If you feel that you are spending too much time on some assignments or preparations because you are "stuck," then start your work earlier so that you can stop (and do other things) and make plans to seek help (see [assistance section above](#assistance)).


### Classroom Conduct and Academic Integrity
<img class="img-right" src="../img/cell-cheat.jpg" alt="Decoration">
My intent is to create a classroom environment where learning can occur. One part of this environment is a well-organized course structure built upon relevant learning resources and interesting realistic exercises. Another part is my availability to assist you in learning from these resources and exercises. A third part is your conduct within the classroom. My expectations of you are that you will fully engage in the course (see above) and be respectful of all others in the class. At a minimum, I expect you to adhere to the following behaviors:

* Please arrive to class on time. If you arrive late, then take the first available seat as quietly as possible. If you need to leave early, then please sit near the exit.
* Please attend the entire class period. Leaving class early defeats the purpose of the class period, does not take advantage of resources (i.e., the professor) that can significantly help your learning, and does not build statistical stamina. Please take care of your personal needs (e.g., using the restroom) before class so that you can stay focused for the entire class period.
* Please turn your computer on immediately so that you can promptly begin the daily preparation check.
* Please limit computer use to class work.
* Please **do not use your own computer** during class unless you clear it with me at the beginning of the semester.
* Please turn off and store out-of-sight cell phones and other electronic devices.
* Please **do not listen to music** (or otherwise wear ear buds) during class.
* Please do not have side discussions while I or others are speaking to the entire class.
*	Please do not sleep in class -- this is rude and distracting to others.
* Please do not use disrespectful language when addressing others.

Finally, note that the [College's Academic Integrity Statement & Policy](https://my.northland.edu/student-policies/academic-policies/#academic-integrity){:target="_blank"} will be followed in this course. Please make sure that you are familiar with its content.

### Footnotes

[^email]: While I am pretty open-minded and not much of a stickler when it comes to e-mail etiquette, some professors are. And it is always better to send an appropriate rather than an inappropriate e-mail. [Here](https://www.scribendi.com/advice/how_to_email_a_professor.en.html) and [here](https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2015/04/16/advice-students-so-they-dont-sound-silly-emails-essay) are some good suggestions for e-mailing professors.

[^studytime]: General advice for how much time should be spent outside of class for each hour inside of class can be found, among many, [here](https://www.collegeparentcentral.com/2010/02/is-your-college-student-investing-enough-time-studying/){:target="_blank"}, [here](http://classroom.synonym.com/ratio-studying-class-time-college-1075.html){:target="_blank"}, [here](https://www.usu.edu/asc/studysmart/pdf/estimating_study_hours.pdf){:target="_blank"}, and [here](http://collegelife.about.com/od/academiclife/f/How-Much-Time-Should-I-Spend-Studying-In-College.htm){:target="_blank"}.
