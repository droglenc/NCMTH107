## Learning Outcomes

<img class="img-right" src="../img/outcomes.jpg" alt="Outcomes">

In this course, you will have the opportunity to:

1. Describe why statistics is central to scientific inquiry (& your field of interest); 
1. Define basic statistical words and symbols; 
1. Design simple experiments and sampling strategies; 
1. Perform appropriate exploratory data analyses (univariate and bivariate); 
1. Identify the purposes of and conduct and interpret the results of a linear regression; 
1. Construct and interpret confidence intervals for one and two-sample mean and proportion problems;
1. Identify the appropriate hypothesis test to perform in one- and two-sample quantitative and categorical data situations; 
1. Construct and interpret the results from a hypothesis test for one- and two-sample quantitative and categorical data situations; and 
1. Communicate statistical results and ideas in a succinct and informative manner. 

This course fulfills that Quantitative Reasoning requirement in the [General Education Program](https://my.northland.edu/faculty/fac-academic-programs/){:target="_blank"} because you will:

* Communicate mathematical information symbolically, visually, numerically, and verbally;
* Use statistical or mathematical models in solving problems; and
* Think critically about the validity of conclusions that are based on statistical or mathematical models.

## Assistance

<img class="img-right" src="../img/help.jpg">
Sources for out-of-class assistance and opportunities for in-class accommodations are described further below. Please use these throughout the semester as appropriate.[^help]

* *Never apologize for asking for what you need, if you don't ask - the answer will always be no.* - Rachel Wolchin
* *Asking for other's guidance helps you see what you may not be able to see. It's always important to check your ego and ask for help.* - Ken Blanchard
* *The only mistake you can make is not asking for help.* - Sandeep Jauhar
* *You don't have to do it all by yourself.* - Elizabeth Dehn 


### Instructor -- Derek Ogle
<img class="img-right" src="../img/DerekOgle1.jpg">
I am committed to your doing well in this course and see it as my responsibility to help you as much as possible both in and out of the designated class period. Thus, you may call (715-682-1300), e-mail (<a href="mailto:dogle@northland.edu">dogle@northland.edu</a>)[^email], or visit me in my office (CSE228) for help. I will make every effort to be available during office hours from 1-3p on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. I will also be available any time that my door is open. Finally, you may send me <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/KC87PJW" target="_blank">anonymous feedback, suggestions, or questions</a>. Please don't hesitate to see or contact me if you have any questions regarding this course.


### Tutors
<img class="img-right" src="../img/AnnaSage_F19.jpg">
AnnaSage Rothe will also be available to help you succeed in this course. AnnaSage is a double major in Sociology and Gender and Womenâ€™s Studies with a minor in Psychology, but she loves math! She also enjoys various outdoor activities, especially snowboarding and paddle boarding. AnnaSage is available on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 6-8 pm in CSE227 (the computer lab next to my office). You may just show up at the tutor sessions but if you know in advance that you will be attending, please send her a quick e-mail saying that you will be there.

### Accommodations
I want to create an inclusive and accessible learning environment for those of you that have a condition (e.g., attention, learning, vision, hearing, mental, physical, or other health-related concern) that may require special accommodations. *If you have already established accommodations* with the Office of Accessibility Resources (OAR), please communicate your approved accommodations to me as soon as possible so that we can discuss your needs in this course. If you have a condition that requires accommodations but *you have not yet established services* through OAR, then you should contact Jennifer Newago as soon as possible (Ponzio 230, x1387, or <a href="mailto:accomodations@northland.edu">accomodations@northland.edu</a>). It is the policy and practice of Northland College to create inclusive and accessible learning environments consistent with federal and state law. <a href="https://my.northland.edu/life/be-healthy/accommodations/">More information is available here.</a>


### Academic Alerts
<img class="img-right" src="../img/alert.jpg">
As you adjust to the rigors of college life, you may struggle a bit in your courses and benefit from working with a professional on your organization, motivation, and stress level. If I observe early in the semester that you are struggling with this course then I may file an "Academic Alert" about you. If this happens, you will receive an e-mail from me that explains steps that you can take to improve your performance in the course. Our Academic Success Coordinator, Gina Kirsten, will receive the alert and will likely also reach out to you to set up a time to further discuss ways to improve in the course. **Academic Alerts are not punitive**, they are simply an attempt to help you get back on track in this course as soon as possible.

----

## Grading

<img class="img-right" src="../img/grading.jpg">
You will have the opportunities described below to demonstrate what you have learned in this course. An overall grade will be computed from these items as shown in the <a href="#overall-grade">Overall Grade section</a> further below.

### Preparation Checks
You should prepare for each class period by reading the reading and watching the videos for the module indicated on the [Dates page](Dates-Current){:target="_blank"} and announced at the end of the previous class period. A preparation guide is provided for each module to help you identify key concepts in the reading and videos ([here's an example](../modules/FoundationalDefns_Prep.html){:target="_blank"}). You should prepare your own **hand-written**[^1] answers or notes to each question on the preparation guide. A "preparation check," for which you can use your notes, but no other resources, will be administered during the first 8 minutes of every class period. **Preparation checks not completed in the first 8 minutes of class cannot be made up. Preparation checks taken from outside of the classroom will not be accepted.**

### Homework

<img class="img-right" src="../img/homework.png">
Each day you will be required to turn in work on the exercises from the previous class period. If you are focused and ask for help during class then most of this work will be completed during class. However, you may need to work outside of class or seek additional help from me or the tutors to complete all of this work. You are allowed to work with other students on exercises, but substantial copying of the work of others does not lead to learning and will not be accepted. The homework you turn in will be graded based on "completeness" according to the following rubric.

<div class="container-fluid">
  <table class="table table-bordered">
  <thead>
    <tr class="info"><th>4 points</th><th>3-1 points</th><th>0 points</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>All parts of the exercise were completed in full. All steps of the work (e.g., intermediate calculations, R code) are provided. Work was neat and orderly.</td><td>Some parts of the exercise were either not attempted or were incomplete. All steps not shown. Work was not as neat and orderly as it should have been.</td><td>Very little of the exercise was completed, many steps not shown, substantial amounts of the work was copied from someone else, or work was very messy and unorganized.</td></tr>
  </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

### Engagement

<img class="img-right" src="../img/participation.jpg" alt="Engagement">
This course is taught in an active learning format and, thus, our time during class is short and precious. The following behaviors are indicative of a fully engaged student:

- Attended the entire class period (including being on time).
- Came to class having fully completed the required preparation materials (see above).
- Diligently worked on the homework exercises.
- Asked pertinent questions.
- Collaboratively worked with others on course material.
- Took notes during short lectures.
- Paid attention during short lectures.
- Followed the [class conduct guidelines](#classroom-conduct-and-academic-integrity).

I will assess your engagement at the end of each class period with the following rubric.

<div class="container-fluid">
  <table class="table table-bordered">
  <thead>
    <tr class="info"><th>4 points</th><th>3-1 points</th><th>0 points</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Fully (see above) engaged in the day's activities. Properly focused at all times.</td><td>Engaged in many, but not all, of the day's activities. Focus waned or was inconsistent. Left early or arrived late by between 1-15 mins.</td><td>Very little active engagement in the day's activities. Lacked focus. Left early or arrived late by more than 15 mins.</td></tr>
  </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

<img class="img-right" src="../img/studying.jpg" alt="Studying Hours">

As a general rule-of-thumb[^2], you are expected to spend 2-3 hours of time outside of class for each hour in class. This course meets for 4.5 hours per week and, thus, you should dedicate between 9 and 13.5 hours of time outside of class preparing for class, completing review and class exercises, and studying for quizzes. **The work required for this course can be completed within this expected amount of time, if that time is without distraction**. If you feel that you are spending an inordinate amount of time on some exercises or preparations because you are "stuck," then start your work earlier so that you can stop (and do other things) and make plans to see [me](#instructor--derek-ogle) or the [tutors](#tutors) for help.


### Quizzes
Four mid-term quizzes will allow you to demonstrate what you have learned about the most recent material. With this number of quizzes, the material on each quiz will be focused on fewer modules and, thus, more manageable to prepare for. Additionally, a final exam will give you an opportunity to show that you have a synthetic understanding of all material from throughout the course. The final exam will be focused on the larger concepts, applications, and interpretations, and less on specific details, from throughout the semester. I will provide you with an explicit study guide approximately one week before each quiz and the final exam.

Dates for quizzes and the final exam are shown on the [Dates page](Dates-Current.html){:target="_blank"}. Make-up quizzes will be provided only if you have a fixed commitment of sufficient importance that was set before the beginning of the semester, or a verifiable medical condition. Please see me immediately if you miss a quiz without my prior approval, but note that you may not be allowed to make up that quiz. **The final exam will NOT be given early.**

Note that your highest quiz score will count for more and your lowest quiz score will count for less in the calculation of your final grade (see [grade weights](#overall-grade) below).


### Extra Credit
Two options for extra credit are:

1. **Quiz Corrections and Reflections** -- For each quiz, **first** complete a correction for each question that you missed, along with *a specific resource that supports your answer* (e.g., a specific page in the reading, a specific video, a specific exercise). You will not receive credit for simply correcting your answer, for providing another incorrect answer, or not providing the resource. You must address every question you missed to receive full credit for this portion.<br/><br/>**Second**, write at least 300 words (one double-spaced page) of *thoughtful* reflections to the following items about the quiz
    * what you did well on the quiz (and why),
    * what you did poorly on the quiz (and why),
    * what you did to prepare for the quiz (be specific ... did you read your notes, read the module readings, watch videos, redo class exercises, do review exercises, etc.)
    * what you did to prepare for the quiz that was helpful,
    * what did you do to prepare for the quiz that was not helpful,
    * what you will change (if anything) in your preparation strategy for the next quiz,
    * was the quiz as you expected (why or why not), and
    * any other comments or suggestions about the quiz.

    Your corrections and reflection *must be typed* (though you can leave space to show your work "by hand" for calculations), easy to read (e.g., neatly organize your corrections by question number), and *must include the original quiz*.<br/><br/>A perfect exam correction and reflection will add the lesser of 15% or the amount it would take for your exam score to be 95%, with two-thirds of the overall grade from the correction (first) portion. Corrections and reflections will be due as announced in class and shown on the [dates](Dates-Current){:target="_blank"} page. **Late corrections and reflections will not be accepted**.

1. **"Statistics in Use" Reports** - Report on the use of statistics in your life -- e.g., from the news, your other courses, or other work that you have done. If you report on a news item, then you should discuss the background of the information in the report, the use of statistics, how the statistics relate to what you have learned in class, how the statistics were presented, how you feel about that presentation, and any questions that you may have. If you report on statistics used in another course, then you should discuss the background of the project where you used statistics, what the statistics were used for (i.e., purpose), a presentation of your statistical work in the report (i.e., findings), how the statistics relate to what you've learned in this course, and any questions that you may have. The FOCUS of your report should be on the statistics used in the news item or course (not just the news item or the topic in the other course) and **specifically how it relates to a topic in this course**. Each report should be typed, at least one page (single-spaced), and include the item being reported on. Your report will be graded on how well it is written **and how well you relate the item to this course**. You may complete up to two reports for as much as 3% extra credit on your final grade. Note that you may not use the same type of news item for more than one report (e.g., you cannot report on presidential race polls more than once). These reports are due as shown on the [dates](Dates-Current){:target="_blank"} page. **Late reports will not be accepted.**

### Overall Grade
An overall score will be computed from the items and associated weights listed in the table below (and described above). To compute your current grade, enter your percentage scores in the boxes for completed assessments. Enter your highest quiz score as the first quiz and your lowest quiz score as the last quiz. To project your future grade, also include percentages for future assessments.

<!-- if the assessment weights change then you must change the values in get_wghts() in the grader.js file -->

  <tr><td>D+ 67-69</td><td>D  60-66</td><td>F   0-59</td></tr>
</table>

**If you meet with me in my office before the end of the second week of classes**, your lowest four preparation check, homework, **AND** engagement grades will be excluded when computing your overall percentage.

#### Note About Incomplete Grades
An incomplete grade will be given ONLY in extreme circumstances that are beyond your control, such as a major illness, and will ONLY be given if you have successfully completed the entire course except for the final exam. This is in accordance with [Northland College policy](https://my.northland.edu/student-policies/academic-policies/#grades){:target="_blank"} (scroll down to "Incomplete Grades").

#### Note About Midterm Grades
I will submit a "midterm grade" for you approximately half-way through the semester. It is important to note that this grade will include only about 1/3rd of the items that will be included in your overall final grade and that. Also note that I will assign the "worst possible" letter grade that I can for your midterm grade. I do this for two reasons. First, I believe that it is better to know the worst rather than the best-case scenario at that point of the semester. Second, the material at the end of the semester is a little more difficult than the material at the beginning of the semester. Of course, see me if you have questions about your midterm grade.

## Classroom Conduct and Academic Integrity

<img class="img-right" src="../img/cell-cheat.jpg" alt="Conduct and Integrity">

My intent is to create a classroom environment where solid learning of statistics can occur. One part of this environment is a well-organized course structure built upon relevant learning resources and interesting realistic exercises. Another part is my availability to assist you in learning from these resources and exercises. A third part is your conduct within the classroom. My expectations of you are that you will fully engage in the course (see above) and be respectful of all others in the class. At a minimum, I expect you to adhere to the following behaviors:

* Please arrive to class on time. If you arrive late, then take the first available seat as quietly as possible. If you need to leave early, then please sit near the exit.
* Please attend the entire class period. Leaving class early defeats the purpose of the class period, does not take advantage of resources (i.e., the professor) that can significantly help your learning, and does not build statistical stamina. Please take care of your personal needs (e.g., using the restroom) before class so that you can stay focused for the entire class period.
* Please turn your computer on immediately so that you can promptly begin the daily preparation check.
* Please limit computer use to class work.
* Please **do not use your own computer** during class unless you clear it with me at the beginning of the semester.
* Please turn off and store out-of-sight cell phones and other electronic devices.
* Please **do not listen to music** (or otherwise wear ear buds) during class.
* Please do not have side discussions while I or others are speaking to the entire class.
*	Please do not sleep in class -- this is rude and distracting to others.
* Please do not use disrespectful language when addressing others.

Finally, note that the [College's Academic Integrity Statement & Policy](https://my.northland.edu/student-policies/academic-policies/#academic-integrity){:target="_blank"} will be followed in this course. Please make sure that you are familiar with its content.

### Footnotes

[^help]: Quotes from [BurnishedChaos.com](https://burnishedchaos.com/quotes-about-asking-for-help/){:target="_blank"}.

[^email]: While I am pretty open-minded and not much of a stickler when it comes to e-mail etiquette, some professors are. And it is always better to send an appropriate rather than an inappropriate e-mail. [Here](https://www.scribendi.com/advice/how_to_email_a_professor.en.html) and [here](https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2015/04/16/advice-students-so-they-dont-sound-silly-emails-essay) are some good suggestions for e-mailing professors.

[^1]: I believe the research (e.g., [here](http://www.medicaldaily.com/why-using-pen-and-paper-not-laptops-boosts-memory-writing-notes-helps-recall-concepts-ability-268770){:target="_blank"}, [here](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/next/body/taking-notes-by-hand-could-improve-memory-wt/){:target="_blank"}, and [here](http://www.lifehack.org/articles/featured/writing-and-remembering-why-we-remember-what-we-write.html){:target="_blank"}) that suggests that you are more likely to remember concepts if you hand-write those concepts down, rather than copy-and-pasting or typing the text.

[^2]: General advice for how much time should be spent outside of class for each hour inside of class can be found, among many, [here](https://www.collegeparentcentral.com/2010/02/is-your-college-student-investing-enough-time-studying/){:target="_blank"}, [here](http://classroom.synonym.com/ratio-studying-class-time-college-1075.html){:target="_blank"}, [here](https://www.usu.edu/asc/studysmart/pdf/estimating_study_hours.pdf){:target="_blank"}, and [here](http://collegelife.about.com/od/academiclife/f/How-Much-Time-Should-I-Spend-Studying-In-College.htm){:target="_blank"}.
