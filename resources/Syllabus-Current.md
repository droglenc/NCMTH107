## Grading
An overall percentage score will be computed from the items and associated weights listed in the table below. To compute your current grade, enter your percentage scores in the boxes for assessments that have been completed. To project your future grade, also include percentages for future assessments.  [*It is your responsibility to track your scores on the individual assessments.*]

<!-- if the assessment weights change then you must change the values in get_wghts() in the grader.js file -->

### Quizzes
A short quiz will be given in the **FIRST 5-10 minutes of EVERY** class period. These quizzes are intended to encourage you to complete the preparation required for that day's class. Thus, quizzes are "open notes" (but **not** "open book" or "open computer"). You will be notified at the end of each class period about which module will form the next class period's quiz. **Missed quizzes cannot be made up and quizzes taken from outside of the classroom will not be accepted.** Your lowest four quiz scores will be excluded when computing your overall grade (*if you meet with me in my office before the end of the second week of class*).


### Participation
This course is taught using active learning, peer-instruction, and inquiry-based pedagogies.  You will be asked to prepare for each class period, answer questions based on your preparations, work with others in small groups, ask questions, and actively work on in-class exercises. Your full participation is critical to your learning and success in this course. To encourage your full participation, I will assess your level of participation at the end of each class period with the following rubric.

<div class="container-fluid">
  <table class="table table-bordered">
  <thead>
    <tr class="info"><th>0 points</th><th>1 point</th><th>2 points</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Very little active participation in the day's activities.</td><td>Participated in many, but not all, of the day's activities</td><td>Fully participated in the day's activities.</td></tr>
  </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

The following behaviors are indicative of full participation:

- Attended the entire class period.
- Diligently worked on the class exercises (or homework assignments if you have completed the class exercise).
- Asked pertinent questions.
- Worked with others on class material.
- Took notes during lectures.
- Paid attention during lectures.
- Followed the [class conduct guidelines](#classroom-conduct-and-academic-integrity).

<img class="img-right" src="../img/studying.jpg">

As a general rule-of-thumb ([here](https://www.collegeparentcentral.com/2010/02/is-your-college-student-investing-enough-time-studying/){:target="_blank"}, [here](http://classroom.synonym.com/ratio-studying-class-time-college-1075.html){:target="_blank"}, [here](https://www.usu.edu/asc/studysmart/pdf/estimating_study_hours.pdf){:target="_blank"}, and [here](http://collegelife.about.com/od/academiclife/f/How-Much-Time-Should-I-Spend-Studying-In-College.htm){:target="_blank"}, among many), students are expected to spend between 2-3 hours of time outside of class for each hour in class.  This course meets for 4.5 hours per week and, thus, you should dedicate between 9 and 13.5 hours of time outside of class to preparing for class, completing homework and other assessments, and studying for exams.  The work required for this course can be completed within this expected amount of time, **if that time is quality-time** (i.e., without distraction).  If you feel that you are spending an inordinate amount of time on some assignments because you are "stuck," then start your assignments early so that you can stop (and do other things) and make plans to see the [tutors](#tutors) or [instructor](#instructor) for help.


### Homework
A homework assigment for each module will generally be due within one week of completing a module (exact due dates will be announced in class). **PRINTED** homework assignments are **due at the beginning of the due date class period; late assignments will not be accepted.** Each assignment should follow [the expectations outlined here](hwformat){:target="_blank"}. An assigment may receive a grade of 0 if it does not follow the required format or is difficult to follow.

Each homework assigment is worth 10 points and will be graded in two parts.  The first part is an assessment of completeness and formatting according to the following rubric.

<div class="container-fluid">
  <table class="table table-bordered">
  <thead>
    <tr class="info"><th>0-1 points</th><th>2-4 points</th><th>5 points</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Very few questions answered completely.</td><td>Most questions answered completely.  <a href="hwformat.html" target="_blank">Format for homework</a> may not have been followed.</td><td>All questions answered completely.  <a href="hwformat.html" target="_blank">Format for homework</a> followed exactly.</td></tr>
  </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

The second part, also worth 5 points, is an assessment of the quality of the work.  In this part, only some (approximately half) of the questions will be assessed.  Answer keys will be [posted online](homework-keys) so that you may check your work.

Your lowest three homework grades will be excluded when computing your overall grade (*if you meet with me in my office before the end of the second week of class*).


### Exams
Exam dates are shown on the [Due Dates page](Dates-Current.html){:target="_blank"}.  Make-up exams will be provided only if you have a fixed commitment of sufficient importance that was set before the beginning of the semester or a verifiable medical condition.  **You will not be allowed to make up an exam missed without my prior approval.  The final exam will not be given early.**


### Extra Credit
Three options for extra credit are:

1. **Exam Corrections** -- Complete a two-part typed correction for each midterm exam.  The **first part** is corrected answers for each question you missed, along with *an explanation of why the answer you originally provided was not correct and why the correct answer is correct.*  You will not receive credit for simply correcting your answer, for providing another incorrect answer, or saying "*I have no idea why I put that answer*," "*I simply wrote the wrong answer*," "*I don't know what I was thinking,*" or any other nonsensical explanation.  You must address every question you missed to receive full credit for this portion.  The **second part** is a *thoughtful* reflection about the exam including what you did well on the exam (and why), what you did poorly on the exam (and why), what strategy you used to prepare for the exam, how you will change your strategy to prepare for the next exam, and whether you considered the exam to be fair or not.  Your reflection must be typed and easy to read (e.g., neatly organize your corrections by question number) and you *must include the original exam*.  A perfect correction will add the lesser of 10% or the amount it would take for your exam score to be 100%, with 1/3rd of the overall grade from the reflection (second part).  Corrections are due one week after the corrected exam is returned (**late corrections will not be accepted**).

1. **"Statistics in Use" Reports** - Report on the use of statistics in your life -- e.g., from the news, your other classes, or other work that you have done.  If you report on a news item, then you should discuss the background of the information in the report, the use of statistics, how the statistics relate to what you have learned in class, how the statistics were presented, how you feel about that presentation, and any questions that you may have.  If you report on statistics used in another class, then you should discuss the background of the project where you used statistics, what the statistics were used for (i.e., purpose), a presentation of your statistical work in the report (i.e., findings), how the statistics relate to what you've learned in this class, and any questions that you may have.  The FOCUS of your report should be on the statistics used in the news item or class (not just the news item or the topic in the other class).  Each report should be typed, at least one page (single-spaced), and include the item being reported on.  Your report will be graded on how well it is written and how well you relate the item to class.  You may complete up to two reports for as much as 3% extra credit on your final grade.  Note that you may not use the same type of news item for more than one report (e.g., you cannot report on presidential race polls more than once).  These reports are due before the last day of class before finals week.  **Late reports will not be accepted.**

1. **Class Project**. -- Complete a [Class Project](project.html) to earn up to 5% extra credit on your final grade.  Note that the topic of your project and the procedures you will follow to collect data **must be approved by me**.


### Incomplete Grades
Under [Northland College policy](https://my.northland.edu/student-policies/academic-policies/#grades){:target="_blank"} (scroll down to "Incomplete Grades"), an incomplete grade will be given ONLY under extreme circumstances beyond your control, such as a major illness.  An incomplete grade will be given ONLY if you have successfully completed the entire course except for the final exam.

## Classroom Conduct and Academic Integrity

Your conduct in class should revolve around the idea of being respectful of all others in the class.  Adhering to the following behaviors should be considered the minimum requirements to being respectful of others:

* Arrive to class on time.  If you arrive late, then take the first available seat as quietly as possible.  If you need to leave early, then please sit near the exit.
* You are expected to attend the entire class period.  Leaving class early defeats the purpose of the class period, does not take advantage of resources (i.e., the professor) that can significantly help your learning, and does not build statistical stamina.
* Turn off and store out-of-sight cell phones and other electronic devices
* Turn your computer on immediately so that you can promptly begin the daily quiz.
* Computer use is limited to class work.
* If you choose to use your own computer, then please sit as far forward in class as possible.
* Do not engage in side discussions while I or others are speaking to the entire class.
*	Do not sleep in class -- this behavior is rude and distracting to others (especially the professor).
* Unpack before and pack after class -- opening and closing  backpacks, rustling of papers or jackets is disruptive and disrespectful to others.
* Do not use disrespectful language when addressing others.

Finally, note that the [College's Academic Integrity Statement & Policy](https://my.northland.edu/student-policies/academic-policies/#academic-integrity){:target="_blank"} will be followed in this course.  Please make sure that you are familiar with its content.
