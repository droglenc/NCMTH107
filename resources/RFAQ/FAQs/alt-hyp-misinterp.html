subtitle: Why does R say the alternative hypothesis is true, even though the p-value>alpha?

<hr />
<p>Typical results from a <code>t.test()</code> (two-sample t-test in this exapmle) look like this.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>&gt; t.test(extra~group,data=sleep,var.equal=TRUE)</code></pre>
<pre><code> Two Sample t-test with extra by group 
t = -1.8608, df = 18, p-value = 0.07919
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 
95 percent confidence interval:
 -3.363874  0.203874 
sample estimates:
mean in group 1 mean in group 2 
           0.75            2.33 </code></pre>
<p>We would not reject the null hypothesis with these results if <span class="math">\(\alpha=0.05\)</span> was being used (note <code>kPvalue(t.test(extra~group,data=sleep,var.equal=TRUE)$p.value)</code><span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span>). However, some students mistakingly interpret the third line of output as saying that the alternative hypothesis is true (and thus the null hypothesis is rejected). R does NOT make the rejection decision for you. The third line of output is simply a reminder of what you set the alternative hypothesis to in <code>alt=</code> of <code>t.test()</code> (note that the default is <code>alt=&quot;two.sided&quot;</code> or “not equals”). You must decide to reject or not to reject the null hypothesis by comparing the p-value reported in the second line of output to the <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> that you have chosen to use.</p>
