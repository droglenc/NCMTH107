\section*{Why Statistics Is Important}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \hypertarget{ans:WhyStatsLakes}{\ref{revex:WhyStatsLakes}} --
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item The areas of the two lakes will likely vary.  Example of natural variability.
      \item The computed proportion will depend on the lakes in the sample.
      \item The computed proportion will depend on the lakes in the sample.  Computed proportions will likely differ between samples.  This is an example of sampling variability.
      \item The proportion in the samples will likely differ from the proportion in the population.  I am not surprised because samples only approximately represent the entire population.
    \end{enumerate}

      \item There are three levels of plowing depth and two levels of fertilizer amount.
      \item There are six total treatments.
      \item There would be six plots in each treatment.
      \item A plot or field is the individual or replicate in this experiment.
      \item I would allocate plots by assigning each plot a unique number from between 1 and 36 and then randomly ordering the numbers between 1 and 36.  Plots corresponding to the first six numbers would go in the first treatment, the next six in the second treatment, and so on.  The random numbers were drawn in R with
<<>>=
sample(36)
@
    \end{enumerate}

  \item \hypertarget{ans:ExpDTrans}{\ref{revex:ExpDTrans}}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item A schematic table for this experiment is shown below.

\begin{tabular}{cc|c|}
 & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Acclimatization} \\
\cline{2-3}
\multicolumn{1}{c|}{Tranquilization} & Allowed & Not Allowed \\
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c|}{Yes} &  & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{} \\
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c|}{No} &  &  \multicolumn{1}{c|}{} \\

      \item The response variable is yield.
      \item There are five vessels allocated to each treatment.
      \item An individual or replicate is a vessel.
      \item I would allocate vessels by assigning each vessels a unique number from between 1 and 30 and then randomly ordering the numbers between 1 and 30.  Plots corresponding to the first five numbers would go in the first treatment, the next five in the second treatment, and so on.  The random numbers were drawn in R with
<<>>=
( vsls <- sample(30) )
@
      \item A table representing this experiment is shown below,

\begin{tabular}{cc|c|c}
 & \multicolumn{3}{c}{Stirring Rates} \\

Temp & 60 rpm & 90 rpm & 120 rpm  \\
\cline{2-4}
\multicolumn{1}{c|}{50C} & \Sexpr{paste(vsls[1:5],collapse=",")} & \Sexpr{paste(vsls[6:10],collapse=",")} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\Sexpr{paste(vsls[11:15],collapse=",")}} \\

\multicolumn{1}{c|}{60C} & \Sexpr{paste(vsls[16:20],collapse=",")} & \Sexpr{paste(vsls[21:25],collapse=",")} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\Sexpr{paste(vsls[26:30],collapse=",")}} \\
\cline{2-4}
\end{tabular}
    \end{enumerate}

  \item \hypertarget{ans:ExpDBP}{\ref{revex:ExpDBP}}

      \item The response variable is the blood pressure reading.
      \item There are eight male subjects per treatment.
      \item A male subject is the individual or replicate in this experiment.
      \item I would allocate male subjects by assigning each male a unique number from between 1 and 32 and then randomly ordering the numbers between 1 and 32.  Plots corresponding to the first eight numbers would go in the first treatment, the next eight in the second treatment, and so on.  The random numbers were drawn in R with
<<>>=
( mls <- sample(32) )
@
      \item A table describing this experiment is shown below.

\begin{tabular}{cc|c|}
 & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Calcium} \\
\cline{2-3}
\multicolumn{1}{c|}{Exercise} & Yes & No \\
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c|}{Yes} & \Sexpr{paste(mls[1:8],collapse=",")} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\Sexpr{paste(mls[9:16],collapse=",")}} \\
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c|}{No} & \Sexpr{paste(mls[17:24],collapse=",")} &  \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\Sexpr{paste(mls[25:32],collapse=",")}} \\
\cline{2-3}
\end{tabular}
    \end{enumerate}

  \item \hypertarget{ans:ObsSWIH}{\ref{revex:ObsSWIH}} -- Observational study; a convenience sample in regards to the selection of the clinics and a voluntary response in regards to the subjects.  Overall, I would call it a voluntary response sample as the individuals of the study are the subjects.

  \item \hypertarget{ans:ObsSDOT}{\ref{revex:ObsSDOT}} -- Observational study; a convenience sample in regards to selecting the subjects but a random sample in regards to the times observed.  Overall, I would call this a random sample as the time periods are the individual of interest (although, any inferences will only pertain to the set of subjects observed in this study).

  \item \hypertarget{ans:ExpDPine}{\ref{revex:ExpDPine}}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item This experiment is summarized in the following table.

\begin{tabular}{cc|c|}
 & \multicolumn{2}{c}{CO (ppm)} \\
\cline{2-3}
\multicolumn{1}{c|}{Salt (ppt)} & 0 & 5 \\
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c|}{0} & 18,20,6,8,12 & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{4,11,19,2,17} \\
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c|}{4} & 14,3,9,15,10 &  \multicolumn{1}{c|}{1,5,7,13,16} \\
\cline{2-3}
\end{tabular}

      \item The treatment with 0 ppm CO and 0 ppt Salt is considered a control because it represents natural (background) levels of CO and salt.  Thus, with regard to the factors being studied, nothing has been done to the seedlings in that treatment.
      \item The experimental (second) study will provide a definitive answer to my hypothesis because it is the only type of study from which ``causal'' statements can be made.  In the experiment, all other variables were controlled for except for the two that I was interested in.  In the observational study, other variables may be responsible for any effect observed.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \hypertarget{ans:quNorm68}{\ref{revex:quNorm68}} --  \textbf{68\%}, directly from the 68-95-99.7 Rule.
  \item \hypertarget{ans:quNorm68gt}{\ref{revex:quNorm68gt}} --  \textbf{16\%}.  68\% are between $\mu\pm\sigma$, which leaves 32\% outside of $\mu\pm\sigma$.  Because normal distribution are symmetric this leaves 16\% in each tail.
  \item \hypertarget{ans:quNorm95gt}{\ref{revex:quNorm95gt}} --  \textbf{97.5\%}.  Similar argument to \ref{revex:quNorm68gt}.
  \item \hypertarget{ans:quNormbt6895}{\ref{revex:quNormbt6895}} --  \textbf{81.5\%}  This can be answered in several ways.  The easiest is to find the total area outside of what was asked for and then subtract from 100\%.  From \ref{revex:quNorm68gt} we know that 16\% is greater than $\mu+1\sigma$ and from \ref{revex:quNorm95gt} we know that 2.5\% is less than $\mu-2\sigma$.  Thus a total of 18.5\% is outside this interval so 100-18.5=81.5\% is within the interval asked for.
  \item \hypertarget{ans:quNorm84}{\ref{revex:quNorm84}} --  \textbf{84\%}.  This is equivalent to asking ``what percentage is less than $\mu+1\sigma$''.  Because 16\% is greater (from \ref{revex:quNorm68gt}), then 84\% must be less.
  \item \hypertarget{ans:quNorm16}{\ref{revex:quNorm16}} --  \textbf{16\%}.  This is equivalent to asking ``what percentage is less than $\mu-1\sigma$''.
  \item \hypertarget{ans:quNorm16a}{\ref{revex:quNorm16a}} --  \textbf{16\%}.  This is equivalent to asking ``what percentage is greater than $\mu+1\sigma$''.

      \item The highway MPG canNOT be predicted with this model as only values of the response variable can be predicted.
      \item The city MPG ca NOT be predicted in this case because 40 mpg on the highway is outside the range of highway mpg in the data used to construct the best-fit line.

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item The explanatory varible is age (AGE).
      \item The response variable is systolic blood pressure (SBP).
      \item The equation of the best-fit line is SBP=$59.389$+$1.601$AGE.
      \item If the age is 0, then the systolic blood pressure will be $59.389$, on average.
      \item For each one year increase in AGE, SBP increases by $1.601$ units, on average.
      \item Male A will have a SBP that is $4.803$ lower than Male B (This is just 3 times the slope).
      \item This prediction should not be made as 70 is outside the domain of the data.

      \item The correlation coefficient is $0.775$ (the square root of the $r^{2}=0.600$).

      \item The response variable is the size of the audience.
      \item The equation of the best-fit line is Audience = $-9610.463$ + $982.541$*Rating
      \item For each 1\% increase in rating the audience size will increase $982.541$ (1000s), on average.
      \item This prediction should not be made as 40.1\% is outside the domain of the data.
      \item The residual in this case is $-23650.22$ (i.e., $40000 - (9610.463 + 982.541*55)$).
      \item The proportion of varibility explained by knowing the rating value is $r^{2}=0.331$
      \item The correlation coefficient is $r=0.575$.
      \item I am concerned that the fitted-line plot exhibits a curvature and a funnel-shape suggesting that both the linearity and homoscedasticity assumptions have been violated.

      \item The response variable is duration.
      \item The equation of the best-fit line is Duration = $70.296$-$0.445$*Start Date.
      \item For each day later that the thrush starts molting the duration of the molt will be $0.445$ days \textbf{shorter}, on average.
      \item If the start date equals zero (July 1st), then the duration of the molt will be $70.296$, on average.
      \item This prediction should not be made because 71 days since July 1 is outside the domain of the data.
      \item The predicted molt duration is $51.161$ d, on average ($70.296-0.445*43$).  Thus, the residual is $-3.161$ d ($48-51.161$).
      \item The correlation coefficient is $r=0.863$ (i.e., square root of $r^{2}$)
      \item The proportion of variability explained by knowing start date (regardless of start date) is $r^{2}=0.744$.
      \item The proportion of variability explained by knowing start date (regardless of start date) is $r^{2}=0.744$.
      \item The slope would get closer to zero as the outlier would pull the line towards it, thus flattening the line out.

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item The explanatory variable is body mass of does.
      \item The response variable is mean fawns per doe.
      \item The equation of the best-fit line is Fawns = $1.960$+$0.0088$Mass
      \item As the mass of the doe increases by 1 kg, then the number of fawns born will increase by 0.0088, on average.
      \item This prediction cannot be made because 45 kg is outside the range of observed body masses.
      \item The residual is $-0.342$ (i.e., $1.9-(1.960+0.0088*32)$)
      \item The correlation coefficient is $0.045$.
      \item The proportion of variability explained by knowing the doe's body mass is $0.002$.
      \item If body mass increases by 5 kg, then the mean number of fawns born to the doe would increase by $0.044$ (i.e., $5*0.0088$).
      \item There does not appear to be a lack of linearity or heteroscedasticity in the fitted-line plot.  However, it is an extremely weak relationship to be basing predictions on.

@
      \item When the date is 0 (January 1), then the wing length will be \Sexpr{formatC(coef(fc.lm)[1],format="f",digits=3)} mm, on average.
      \item For each day increase in the migration, the average wing length decreases by \Sexpr{formatC(-1*coef(fc.lm)[2],format="f",digits=3)} mm.
      \item This is 10 times the unit change in length by day. Thus, $10*$\Sexpr{formatC(coef(fc.lm)[2],format="f",digits=3)} = \Sexpr{formatC(10*coef(fc.lm)[2],format="f",digits=2)}.

      \item The data appear to be linear but there is a slight hint of heteroscedasticity, though this hint is largely due to the slight outlier in the lower-right corner of the fitted-line plot \figrefp{fig:FlyCatFitPlot}.  The fitted-line plot was constructed with

<<>>=
( cf.lm <- lm(adjdeath~fatintake,data=cf) )
@
      \item The interpretation of the slope is that for every increase of 1 g/day consumption of animal fat the per capita death rate due to breast cancer will increase \Sexpr{formatC(coef(cf.lm)[2],format="f",digits=3)} units, on average.
      \item Because of the interpretation of the slope, country A will have an age adjusted death rate due to breast cancer that is $(-4)*$\Sexpr{formatC(coef(cf.lm)[2],format="f",digits=3)} = \Sexpr{formatC(4*coef(cf.lm)[1],format="f",digits=3)} units \textbf{lower} than country B, on average.
      \item This question cannot be answered because 170 g/day is outside the range of the \var{fatintake} data used to construct the relationship.
      \item  The residual is \Sexpr{formatC(14.5 - predict(cf.lm,data.frame(fatintake=90)),format="f",digits=1)} as found with

      \item No, you cannot say that the intake of animal fat is the CAUSE for the increase in age adjusted death rate because these data were not collected from an experiment. Causal statements cannot be made from observational studies (which this one obviously is) because many other unmonitored or lurking variables may explain the relationship.

      \item This is basically the same as the previous question -- the difference in predicted temperature should be three ``slopes'' or \Sexpr{formatC(3*coef(ch.lm)[1],format="f",digits=3)}.  Thus, it will be \Sexpr{formatC(3*coef(ch.lm)[1],format="f",digits=3)} degrees warmer during the day, on average.
      \item Twelve chirps is outside the domain of the chirps variable; thus, this question is an extrapolation that should not be answered.

The null hypothesis says that the animal's population size is not declining, it is remaining stable over time.  The alternative hypothesis is that the animal's population is declining.  If the null hypothesis is true and you reject it (i.e., you say the population is declining when it really isn't) you have made a type I error.  This will likely lead resource managers to take actions to protect the animal.  This is not necessarily a bad thing for the animal, although it may be costly.  Conversely, if the null hypothesis is false and you fail to reject it (i.e., the animal is really declining but you say that it isn't), then you have made a type II error.  This is much more egregious mistake because now you will take no action to protect the animal; it may go extinct.  To me, losing an animal is much more costly (important) than overprotecting the animal.

      \item $z=\frac{3.26-4}{\frac{1.40}{\sqrt{10}}}$=$\frac{-0.74}{0.44}$=$-1.67$.
      \item The p-value is \Sexpr{kPvalue(distrib(3.26,mean=4,sd=1.40/sqrt(10),plot=FALSE))} as computed with
<<par1a=TRUE>>=
( distrib(3.26,mean=4,sd=1.40/sqrt(10)) )
@
      \item $H_{O}$ is rejected in favor of $H_{A}$ because the $p-value<\alpha$.
      \item The mean growth rate of all cacti under the experimental conditions does appear to be less than 4 cm.
      \item A 95\% upper confidence bound is warranted in this situation and will use a $Z^{*}=$\Sexpr{formatC(distrib(0.95,type="q",plot=FALSE),format="f",digits=3)}, as computed with
<<par1a=TRUE>>=
( distrib(0.95,type="q") )
@
Thus, $3.26+1.645*0.44$ or $3.26+0.72$ = $3.98$.  Thus, one is 95\% confident that the mean growth of all cacti under the experimental conditions is less than 3.98 cm.
    \end{enumerate}

  \item \hypertarget{ans:HypTestZPike}{\ref{revex:HypTestZPike}} --
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item $\alpha=0.05$. (Note: this is a bit more difficult to get in this question.  The 95\% confidence statement along with the fact that the alternative hypothesis is two=tailed implies, by working backwards from the prescribed level of confidence for step 11, that $\alpha=0.05$.)
      \item $H_{O}:\mu=600$, $H_{A}:\mu\neq600$ where $\mu$ is the mean length of all pike in Lake Baikal.
      \item A one-sample Z-test is required because a quantitative variable (length) was measured on individuals from one population (Lake Baikal), the population mean is compared to a specific value in the null hypothesis, and $\sigma$ is known (given in the background).
      \item Observational study with $n=30$ pike.  No obvious randomization.
      \item $n>15$ and the population is not strongly skewed (background says ``slightly'' right-skewed); $\sigma$ is known.
      \item $\bar{x}=656.1$
      \item $z=\frac{656.1-600}{\frac{130}{\sqrt{30}}}$ = $2.363$
      \item The p-value is \Sexpr{kPvalue(2*distrib(656.1,mean=600,sd=130/sqrt(30),lower.tail=FALSE,plot=FALSE))} as computed with
<<par1a=TRUE>>=
( 2*distrib(656.1,mean=600,sd=130/sqrt(30),lower.tail=FALSE) )
@
      \item Reject $H_{O}$ because the $p-value<\alpha$.
      \item The true mean length of all pike in Lake Baikal appears to be different than 600 mm.
      \item A 95\% confidence interval is warranted in this situation and will use a $Z^{*}=\pm$\Sexpr{formatC(distrib(0.05/2,type="q",lower.tail=FALSE,plot=FALSE),format="f",digits=3)}, as computed with
<<par1a=TRUE>>=
( distrib(0.05/2,type="q",lower.tail=FALSE) )
@
Thus, $656.1\pm1.96*23.74$, $656.1\pm46.53$, or $(609.57, 702.63)$.  Therefore, one is 95\% confident that true mean length of all pike in Lake Baikal is between 609.6 and 702.6 mm.

      \item A 90\% lower confidence bound is \Sexpr{formatC(pain.z$conf.int[1],format="f",digits=2)}.  One is 90\% confident that the mean duration of pain for all patients is more than \Sexpr{formatC(pain.z$conf.int[1],format="f",digits=2)} years.

      \item A two-sample t-test is required because a quantitative variable (BTUs) was measured on two populations (electric and thermal vents) that were \textbf{IN}dependent and two population means are compared in the null hypothesis.
      \item The data are part of an observational study where it is not obvious that the devices were randomly allocated to houses.
      \item The samples are independent (no vent was placed in the same house).  The sample size ($n_{e}+n_{t}$=90) is $>40$.  Therefore, the test statistic computed below should reasonably follow a t-distribution with $n_{e}+n_{t}-2=88$ df.

      \item A two-sample t-test is required quantitative variable (backfat thickness) was measured on two populations (different diets) that were \textbf{IN}dependent and two population means are compared in the null hypothesis.
      \item The data are part of an experimental study where the pigs were randomly allocated to treatments.
      \item The samples are independent (no pig was fed both diets).  The sample size ($n_{1}+n_{2}$=25) is $<40$ but $>15$ and the sample distributions (i.e., histograms) are not strongly skewed.  Therefore, the test statistic computed below should reasonably follow a t-distribution with $n_{1}+n_{2}-2=22$ df.  The population variances appear to be equal because the p-value for Levene's test of the homogeneity of variance test (given as 0.532) is ``large'' (i.e., $>\alpha=0.05$).
      \item The statistic is $\bar{x}_{1}-\bar{x}_{2}$ = $3.420-2.989$ = $0.431$.  The pooled sample variance is $s_{p}^{2}=\frac{(12-1)0.295^{2}+(12-1)0.375^{2}}{12+12-2}$ = $0.1138$.  The standard error of the statistic is $SE_{\bar{x}_{1}-\bar{x}_{2}}=\sqrt{0.1138\left(\frac{1}{12}+\frac{1}{12} \right)}$ = $0.1377$.

      \item There does appear to be a difference in average backfat thickness between pigs fed the two diets.

<<par1a=TRUE>>=
( distrib(0.025,distrib="t",type="q",df=22,lower.tail=FALSE) )
@
Thus, $0.431\pm2.074*0.1377$, $0.431\pm0.286$, and $(0.145,0.717)$.  One is 95\% confident that the difference in mean backfat thickness is between 0.145 and 0.717 cm.  Thus, the mean backfat thickness on all pigs fed diet 1 is between 0.145 and 0.717 cm greater than the mean backfat thickness of all pigs fed diet 2.  Thus, diet 2 produces higher quality pork.

      \item A goodness-of-fit test is required because a categorical variable (habitat type) with four levels from a single population (these shrikes) was recorded and the frequency of individuals in each level is being compared to a theoretical distribution in the null hypothesis.
      \item The data appear to be part of an observational study where the individuals were not randomly selected but the location to look for the individuals was.
      \item The expected frequencies are equal to the total number of observations times the proportion of each habitat type available.  For example, the expected number of shrikes in the settled sub-habitat is $1456*0.205$ = $298.48$.  The expectations for the other habitats are computed similarly and are shown in the ``Exp. Freq.'' column of the table below.  There is more than five individuals in each of the four levels of the expected table.  Thus, the test statistic below should follow a $\chi^{2}$ distribution.
