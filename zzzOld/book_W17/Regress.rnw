\lettrine{L}{inear regression analysis is used to model the relationship} between two quantitative variables for two related purposes -- (i) explaining variability in the response variable and (ii) predicting future values of the response variable.\index{Regression!Purposes}  Examples include predicting ...
\begin{Itemize}
  \item ... the future sales of a product from its price.
  \item ... family expenditures on recreation from family income.
  \item ... an animal's food consumption in relation to ambient temperature.
  \item ... a person's score on a German assessment test based on how many years the person studied German.
\end{Itemize}

\warn{Explaining variability of and predicting future values of response variables are the two goals of regression.}

Exact predictions cannot be made because of natural variability.  For example, two people with the same intake of mercury (from consumption of fish) will not have the same level of mercury in their blood stream (e.g., observe the two individuals in \figref{fig:HGscat} that had intakes of 580 ug HG/day).  Thus, the best that can be accomplished is to predict the average or expected value for a person with a particular intake value.  This is accomplished by finding the line that best ``fits'' the points on a scatterplot of the data and using that line to make predictions.  Finding and using the ``best-fit'' line is the topic of this module.

\section{Response and Explanatory Variables}
\vspace{-12pt}
Recall from \sectref{sect:RespExplan1} that the response (or dependent) variable is the variable to be predicted or explained and the explanatoroy (or independent) variale is the variable that will help do the predicting or explaining.\index{Response Variable!Regression}\index{Explanatory Variable!Regression}  In the examples mentioned above, future sales, family expenditures on recreation, the animal's food consumption, and score on the assessment test are response variables and product price, family income, temperature, and years studying German are explanatory variables, respectively.  The response variable is on the y-axis and the explanatory variable is on the x-axis of scatterplots.

\defn{Response Variable}{The variable that will be explained or predicted.}

\vspace{-12pt}
\defn{Explanatory Variable}{The variable that may explain or be used to predict the response variable.}

\begin{exsection}
  \item \label{revex:RegRivers1} \cite{Dudgeon2000}, while describing the features of major tropical Asian rivers, examined the relationship between the length (km) and drainage area (km$^{2}$) of 11 waterways.  In particular he wanted to determine if a model could be produced that would allow the drainage area of the river to be predicted from the length of the river.  Identify the response and explanatory variables.  Explain your choices. \ansref{ans:RegRivers1}
  \item \label{revex:RegBirth1} Researchers collected data on 56 normal births at a Wellington, New Zealand hospital.  They were interested in determining if the weight of the newborn child (labeled as \var{BirthWt}) could be predicted by knowing the mothers age (labeled as \var{Age}).  Identify the response and explanatory variables.  Explain your choices. \ansref{ans:RegBirth1}
\end{exsection}


\section{Slope and Intercept}\index{Line!General Equation}
The equation of a line is commonly expressed as,
  \[ y = mx + b  \]
where both $x$ and $y$ are variables, $m$ represents the slope of the line, and $b$ represents the y-intercept.\footnote{Hereafter, simply called the ``intercept.''}  It is important that you can look at the equation of a line and identify the response variable, explanatory variable, slope, and intercept.  The response variable will always appear on one side of the equation (usually the left) by itself.   The value or symbol that is multiplied by the explanatory variable (e.g., $x$) is the slope, and the value or symbol by itself is the intercept.  For example, in
\[ blood = 3.501 + 0.579*intake \]
\var{blood} is the response variable, \var{intake} is the explanatory variable, $0.579$ is the slope (it is multiplied by the explanatory variable), and $3.501$ is the intercept (it is not multiplied by anything in the equation).  The same conclusions would be made if the equation had been written as
  \[ blood = 0.579*intake+3.501 \]

\warn{In the equation of a line, the slope is always multiplied by the explanatory variable and the intercept is always by itself.}

In addition to being able to identify the slope and intercept of a line you also need to be able to interpret these values.  Most students define the slope as ``rise over run'' and the intercept as ``where the line crosses the y-axis.''  These ``definitions'' are very loose geometric representations.  For our purposes, the slope and intercept must be more strictly defined.

To define the slope, first think of ``plugging'' two values of intake into the equation discussed above.  For example, if $intake=100$, then $blood=3.501+0.579*100$=\Sexpr{formatC(3.501+0.579*100,format="f",digits=2)} and if $intake$ is one unit larger (i.e., $intake=101$), then $blood=3.501+0.579*101$=\Sexpr{formatC(3.501+0.579*101,format="f",digits=2)}.\footnote{For simplicity of exposition, the actual units are not used in this discussion. However, ``units'' would usually be replaced with the actual units used for the measurements.}  The difference between these two values is \Sexpr{formatC(3.501+0.579*101,format="f",digits=2)}-\Sexpr{formatC(3.501+0.579*100,format="f",digits=2)}=$0.579$.  Thus, it is seen that the slope is the change in value of the response variable for a single unit change in the value of the explanatory variable \figrefp{fig:SlopeInt}.\index{Slope!Definition}  That is, mercury in the blood changes 0.579 units for a single unit change in mercury intake.  So, if an individual increases mercury intake by one unit, then mercury in the blood will increase by 0.579 units, ON AVERAGE.  Alternatively, if one individual has one more unit of mercury intake than another individual, then the first individual will have, ON AVERAGE, 0.579 more units of mercury in the blood.

@

To define the intercept, first ``plug'' $intake=0$ into the equation discussed above; i.e., $blood=3.501+0.579*0$=$3.501$.  Thus, the intercept is the value of the response variable when the explanatory variable is equal to zero \figrefp{fig:SlopeInt}.\index{Intercept!Definition}  In this example, the average mercury in the blood for an individual with no mercury intake is 3.501.  Many times, as is true with this example, the interpretation of the intercept will be nonsensical.  This is because $x=0$ will likely be outside the range of the data collected and, perhaps, outside the range of possible data that could be collected.

The equation of the line is a model for the relationship depicted in a scatterplot.  Thus, the interpretations for the slope and intercept represent the \textit{average} change or the \textit{average} response variable.  Thus, whenever a slope or intercept is being interpreted it must be noted that the result is an \textit{average} or \textit{on average}.

\section{Predictions}\index{Regression!Predictions}\index{Predictions!Regression}
Once a best-fit line has been identified (criteria for doing so is discussed in \sectref{sect:BestFitLine}), the equation of the line can be used to predict the average value of the response variable for individuals with a particular value of the explanatory variable.  For example, the best-fit line for the mercury data shown in \figref{fig:HGscat} is
  \[ blood = 3.501 + 0.579*intake \]
Thus, the predicated average level of mercury in the blood for an individual that consumed 240 ug HG/day is found with
  \[ blood = 3.501 + 0.579*240 = 142.461 \]
Similarly, the predicted average level of mercury in the blood for an individual that consumed 575 ug HG/day is found with
  \[ blood = 3.501 + 0.579*575 = 336.426 \]
A prediction may be visualized by finding the value of the explanatory variable on the x-axis, drawing a vertical line until the best-fit line is reached, and then drawing a horizontal line over to the y-axis where the value of the response variable is read \figrefp{fig:HGpredict}.

\defn{Predicted Value}{The value of $y$ on the best-fit line at the observed value of $x$; abbreviated as $\hat{y}_{i}$ for the $i$th individual.}

\vspace{-12pt}
\warn{The predicted value of the response variable at a given value of the explanatory variable is found by ``plugging'' the value of the explanatory variable into the equation of the line.}

When predicting values of the response variable, it is important to not extrapolate beyond the range of the data.  In other words, predictions with values outside the range of observed values of the explanatory variable should be made cautiously (if at all).  An excellent example would be to consider the height ``data'' collected during the early parts of a human's life (say the first ten years).  During these early years there is likely a good fit between height (the response variable) and age.  However, using this relationship to predict an individual's height at age 40 would likely result in a ridiculous answer (i.e., probably over ten feet).  The problem here is that the linear relationship only holds for the observed (i.e., the first ten years of life); it is not known if the same linear relationship exists outside that range of years.  In fact, with human heights, it is generally known that growth first slows, eventually quits, and may, at very old ages, actually decline.  Thus, the linear relationship found early in life does not hold for later years.  Critical mistakes can be made when using a linear relationship to extrapolate outside the range of the data.

\warn{When making predictions of the response variable, do not extrapolate beyond the range of the data.}

\section{Residuals}
The predicted value is a ``best-guess'' for an individual based on the best-fit line.  The actual value for any individual is likely to be different from this predicted value.  The \textbf{residual} is a measure of how ``far off'' the prediction is from what is actually observed.\index{Residual!Definition}\index{Residual!Computation}  Specifically, the residual for an individual is found by subtracting the predicted value (given the individual's observed value of the explanatory variable) from the individual's observed value of the response variable, or
  \[ \text{residual}=\text{observed response}-\text{predicted response} \]
For example, consider an individual that has an observed intake of 650 and an observed level of mercury in the blood of 480.  As shown in the previous section, the predicted level of mercury in the blood for this individual is
  \[ blood = 3.501 + 0.579*650 = 379.851 \]
The residual for this individual is then $480-379.851$ = $100.149$.  This positive residual indicates that the observed value is approximately 100 units greater than the average for individuals with an intake of 650.\footnote{In other words, the observed value is ``above'' the line.}  As a second example, consider an individual with an observed intake of 250 and an observed level of mercury in the blood of 105.  The predicted value for this individual is
  \[ blood = 3.501 + 0.579*250 = 148.251 \]
and the residual is $105-148.251$ = $-43.251$.  This negative residual indicates that the observed value is approximately 43 units less than the average for individuals with an intage of 250.  A residuals is the vertical distance between an individual's point and the best-fit line \figrefp{fig:HGresidual}.

\defn{Residual}{The vertical difference between the observed and predicted values of the response variable for an individual; computed as the difference between the observed and predicted values of the response.}

\section{Best-fit Criteria}\label{sect:BestFitLine}\index{Regression!Finding best-fit line}
\vspace{-12pt}
An infinite number of lines can be placed on a graph, but many of those lines do not adequately describe the data.  In contrast, many of the lines will appear, to our eye, to adequately describe the data.  So, how does one find THE best-fit line from all possible lines. The \textbf{least-squares} method described below provides a quantifiable and objective measure of which line best ``fits'' the data.

Residuals are a measure of how far an individual is from a candidate best-fit line.  Residuals computed from all individuals in a data set is a measure of how far all individuals are from the candidate best-fit line.  Thus, the residuals for all individuals can be used to identify the best-fit line. The residual sum-of-squares (RSS) is the sum of all squared residuals.\index{RSS}  The least-squares criterion says that the ``best-fit'' line is the one line out of all possible lines that has the minimum RSS \figref{fig:RSSanim}.

\vspace{-12pt}
\warn{The least-squares criterion is that the ``best-fit'' line is the line of all possible lines with the minimum RSS.}

The disucssion thusfar implies that all possible lines must be ``fit'' to the data and the one with the minimum RSS is chosen as the ``best-fit'' line.  As there are an infinite number of possible lines, this would be impossible to do.  Theoretical statisticians have shown that the application of the least-squares criterion always produces a best-fit line with a slope given by\index{Slope!Calculation}\index{Intercept!Calculation}
  \[ slope = r\frac{s_{y}}{s_{x}}  \]
and an intercept given by
  \[ intercept = \bar{y}-slope*\bar{x}   \]
Thus, using these formulas finds the slope and intercept for the line, out of all possible lines, that minimizes the RSS.

While all five assumptions of linear regression are important, only the first two are vital when the best-fit line is being used primarily as a descriptive model for data.\footnote{In contrast to using the model to make inferences about a population model.}  Description is the primary goal of linear regression used in this course and, thus, only the first two assumptions are considered further.

The linearity assumption appears obvious -- if a line does not represent the data, then don't try to fit a line to it!  Violations of this assumption are evident by a non-linear or curving form in the scatterplot.  The homoscedasticity assumption states that the variability about the line is the same for all values of the explanatory variable.\index{Homoscedasticity} In other words, the dispersion of the data around the line must be the same everywhere along the entire line.  Violations of this assumption generally present as a ``funnel-shaped'' dispersion of points from left-to-right on a scatterplot.

Violations of these assumptions are often evident on ``fitted-line plots'' -- i.e., scatterplots with the best-fit line superimposed \figrefp{fig:ResidPlotEx}.\footnote{Residual plots, not discussed in this text, are another plot that often times is used to better assess assumption violations.}  If the points look more-or-less like random scatter around the best-fit line, then neither the linearity nor the homoscedasticity assumption has been violated.

In this text, if an assumption has been violated, then one should not continue to interpret the linear regression.  However, in many instances, an assumption violation can be ``corrected'' by transforming one or both variables to a different scale.  Transformations are not discussed in this book.

\warn{If the regression assumptions are not met, then the regression results should not be interpreted.}

\section{Coefficient of Determination}\index{r-squared@{$r^{2}$}}
\vspace{-12pt}
The coefficient of determination, abbreviated as $r^{2}$, is the proportion of the total variability in the response variable that is explained away by knowing the value of the explanatory variable and the best-fit model.  The $r^{2}$ can take values between 0 and 1.\footnote{It is common for $r^{2}$ to be presented as a percentage.}  In simple linear regression, $r^{2}$ is literally the square of $r$, the correlation coefficient.\footnote{Simple linear regression is the fitting of a model with a single explanatory variable and is the only model considered in this module and this course. See \sectref{sect:corr} for a review of the correlation coefficient.}

\defn{Coefficient of Determination}{The proportion of the total variability in the response variable that is explained away by knowing the value of the explanatory variable and the best-fit model; abbreviated as $r^{2}$.}

\vspace{-12pt}
\warn{$r^{2}$ can take values between 0 and 1.}

The meaning of $r^{2}$ can be examined by considering predictions of the response variable with and without knowledge of the value of the explanatory variable.  First, consider predicting the value of a particular response variable without any information about the explanatory variable.  In this case, the best prediction for the value of the response variable is to use the sample mean of the response variable (represented by the dashed blue horizontal line in \figref{fig:CoeffDeterm}).  However, because of natural variability, not all individuals will have this value.  Thus, the prediction might be ``bracketed'' by saying that the individual will be between the observed minimum and maximum values (solid blue horizontal lines).  Loosely speaking, this range can be thought of as the ``total variability in the response variable'' (blue box).

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=5in]{Figs/rsq3.png}
  \caption{Fitted line plot with visual representations of variabilities explained and unexplained.  A full explanation is in the text.}
  \label{fig:CoeffDeterm}
\end{figure}

Suppose now that interest is in predicting the value of the response variable for an individual with a known value of the explanatory variable (at the dashed vertical red line in \figref{fig:CoeffDeterm}).  The predicted value for this individual is the value of the response variable at the corresponding point on the best-fit line (dashed horizontal red line).  Again, because of natural variability, not all individuals with this value of the explanatory variable will have this exact value of the response variable.  However, the prediction is now ``bracketed'' by the minimum and maximum value of the response variable \textbf{ONLY} for those individuals with the particular value of the explanatory variable (solid red horizontal lines).  Loosely speaking, this range can be thought of as the ``variability in the response variable remaining after knowing the value of the explanatory variable'' (red box).  This is the variability in the response variable that remains even after knowing the value of the explanatory variable or the variability in the response variable that cannot be explained away (by the explanatory variable).

The portion of the total variability in the response variable that was explained away consists of all the values of the response variable that would no longer be entertained as possible predictions once the value of the explanatory variable is known (green box in \figref{fig:CoeffDeterm}).  Now, by the definition of $r^{2}$, the computation of $r^{2}$ can be visualized as the area of the green box divided by the area of the blue box.  This calculation does not depend on which value of the explanatory variable is chosen as long as the data are evenly distributed around the line (i.e., homoscedastic -- see \sectref{sect:RegAssumptions}).

If the variability explained away (the green box in \figref{fig:CoeffDeterm}) approaches the total variability in the response variable (the blue box), then $r^{2}$ approaches 1.  This will happen only if the variability about the line approaches zero.  In contrast, the variability explained (the green box) will approach zero if the slope is zero (i.e., there is no relationship between the response and explanatory variables).  Thus, values of $r^{2}$ also indicate the strength of the relationship; values near 1 are stronger than values near 0.  Values near 1 also mean that predictions will be fairly accurate -- i.e., there is little variability remaining after knowing the explanatory variable.

\warn{A value of $r^{2}$ near 1 represents a strong relationship between the response and explanatory variables that will lead to accurate predictions.}


\section{Examples I}
There are twelve questions that are commonly asked about linear regression results.  These twelve questions are listed below with some hints about things to remember when answering some of the questions.  An example of these questions in context is then provided.

\begin{Enumerate}
  \item What is the response variable?  \textit{Identify which variable is to be predicted or explained, which variable is dependent on another variable, which would be hardest to measure, or which is on the y-axis.}
  \item What is the explanatory variable?  \textit{The remaining variable after identifying the response variable.}
  \item Comment on linearity and homoscedasticity.  \textit{Examine fitted-line plot for curvature (i.e., non-linearity) or a funnel-shape (i.e., heteroscedasticity).}
  \item What is the equation of the best-fit line?  \textit{In the generic equation of the line ($y=mx+b$) replace $y$ with the name of the response variable, $x$ with the name of the explanatory variable, $m$ with the value of the slope, and $b$ with the value of the intercept.}
  \item Interpret the value of the slope.  \textit{Comment on how the response variable changes by slope amount for each one unit change of the explanatory variable, on average.}
  \item Interpret the value of the intercept.  \textit{Comment on how the response variable equals the intercept, on average, if the explanatory variable is zero.}
  \item Make a prediction given a value of the explanatory variable.  \textit{Plug the given value of the explanatory variable into the equation of the best-fit line.}
  \item Compute a residual given values of both the explanatory and response variables.  \textit{Make a prediction (see previous question) and then subtract this value from the observed value of the response.}
  \item Identify an extrapolation in the context of a prediction problem.  \textit{Examine the x-axis scale on the fitted-line plot and do not make predictions outside of the plotted range.}
  \item What is the proportion of variability in the response variable explained by knowing the value of the explanatory variable?  \textit{This is $r^{2}$.}
  \item What is the correlation coefficient?  \textit{This is the square root of $r^{2}$.  Make sure to put a negative sign on the result if the slope is negative.}
  \item How much does the response variable change if the explanatory variable changes by X units?  \textit{This is an alternative to asking for an interpretation of the slope.  If the explanatory variable changes by X units, then the response variable will change by X*slope units, on average.}
\end{Enumerate}

All answers should refer to the variables of the problem -- thus, ``y'', ``x'', ``response'', or ``explanatory'' should not be in any part of any answer.  The questions about the slope, intercept, and predictions need to explicitly identify that the answer is an ``average'' or ``on average.''

\subsection*{Chimp Hunting Parties}
\begin{quote}
\textit{\cite{Stanford1996} gathered data to determine if the size of the hunting party (number of individuals hunting together) affected the hunting success of the party (number of hunts that resulted in a kill) for wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) at Gombe.  The results of their analysis for 17 hunting parties is shown in the figure below.\footnote{These data are in \href{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/Chimp.csv}{Chimp.csv}.}  Use these results to answer the questions below.}

\begin{QAlist}
  \item What is the response variable?
  \begin{QAlist}
    \item The response variable is the percent of successful hunts because the authors are attempting to see if success depends on hunting party size.  In addition, the percent of successful hunts is shown on the y-axis.
  \end{QAlist}
  \item What is the explanatory variable?
  \begin{QAlist}
    \item The explanatory variable is the size of the hunting party.
  \end{QAlist}
  \item In terms of the variables of the problem, what is the equation of the best-fit line?
  \begin{QAlist}
    \item The equation of the best-fit line for this problem is \% Success of Hunt = \Sexpr{formatC(coef(lm.chimp)[1],format="f",digits=3)} + \Sexpr{formatC(coef(lm.chimp)[2],format="f",digits=3)}*Number of Hunting Party Members.
  \end{QAlist}
  \item Interpret the value of the slope in terms of the variables of the problem.
  \begin{QAlist}
    \item The slope indicates that for every increase of one member to the hunting party the percent of successful hunts increases by \Sexpr{formatC(coef(lm.chimp)[2],format="f",digits=3)}, on average.
  \end{QAlist}
  \item Interpret the value of the intercept in terms of the variables of the problem.
  \begin{QAlist}
    \item The intercept indicates that a hunting party with no members will have a percent of successful hunts of \Sexpr{formatC(coef(lm.chimp)[1],format="f",digits=3)}, on average.
  \end{QAlist}
  \item What is the predicted hunt success if the hunting party consists of 20 chimpanzees?
  \begin{QAlist}
    \item The predicted hunt success for parties with 20 individuals is an extrapolation, because 20 is outside the range of the number of members observed on the x-axis of the fitted-line plot.
  \end{QAlist}
  \item What is the predicted hunt success if the hunting party consists of 12 chimpanzees?
  \begin{QAlist}
    \item The predicted hunt success for parties with 12 individuals is \Sexpr{formatC(coef(lm.chimp)[1],format="f",digits=3)} + \Sexpr{formatC(coef(lm.chimp)[2],format="f",digits=3)}*12 = \Sexpr{formatC(coef(lm.chimp)[1]+coef(lm.chimp)[2]*12,format="f",digits=1)}\%.
  \end{QAlist}
  \item What is the residual if the hunt success for 10 individuals is 50\%?
  \begin{QAlist}
    \item The residual in this case is $50$-(\Sexpr{formatC(coef(lm.chimp)[1],format="f",digits=3)} + \Sexpr{formatC(coef(lm.chimp)[2],format="f",digits=3)}*10) = $50$-\Sexpr{formatC(coef(lm.chimp)[1]+coef(lm.chimp)[2]*10,format="f",digits=1)} = \Sexpr{formatC(50-(coef(lm.chimp)[1]+coef(lm.chimp)[2]*10),format="f",digits=1)}.  Therefore, it appears that the success of this hunting party is \Sexpr{formatC(-1*(50-(coef(lm.chimp)[1]+coef(lm.chimp)[2]*10)),format="f",digits=1)}\% lower than average for this size of hunting party.
  \end{QAlist}
  \item What proportion of the variability in hunting success is explained by knowing the size of the hunting party?
  \begin{QAlist}
    \item The proportion of the variability in hunting success that is explained by knowing the size of the hunting party is $r^{2}$=\Sexpr{formatC(rSquared(lm.chimp),format="f",digits=2)}.
  \end{QAlist}
  \item What is the correlation between hunting success and size of hunting party?
  \begin{QAlist}
    \item The correlation between hunting success and size of hunting party is $r=$\Sexpr{formatC(sqrt(rSquared(lm.chimp)),format="f",digits=2)}.
  \end{QAlist}
  \item How much does hunt success decrease, on average, if there are two fewer individuals in the party?
  \begin{QAlist}
    \item If the hunting party has two fewer members, then the hunting success would decrease by \Sexpr{formatC(2*coef(lm.chimp)[2],format="f",digits=1)}\% (i.e., $-2$*\Sexpr{formatC(coef(lm.chimp)[2],format="f",digits=3)}), on average.
  \end{QAlist}
  \item Does any aspect of this regression concern you (i.e., consider the regression assumptions)?
  \begin{QAlist}
    \item The data appear to be very slightly curved but there is no evidence of a funnel-shape.  Thus, the data may be slightly non-linear but they appear homoscedastic.
  \end{QAlist}
\end{QAlist}

The linear regression model is fit to two quantitative variables with \R{lm()}.  The first argument is a formula of the form \R{response\TILDE explanatory}, where \R{response} contains the response variable and \R{explanatory} contains the explanatory variable, and the corresponding data.frame is in \R{data=}.  The results of \R{lm()} should be assigned to an object so that specific results can be extracted.

\warn{The same formula is used to make a scatterplot with \R{plot()} and find the best-fit line with \R{lm()}.}

<<echo=FALSE>>=
lm1 <- lm(blood~intake,data=merc)
@

The regression was fit to the mercury data below. From this it is seen that the intercept is \Sexpr{formatC(coef(lm1)[1],format="f",digits=3)} and the slope is \Sexpr{formatC(coef(lm1)[2],format="f",digits=3)}.
<<>>=
( lm1 <- lm(blood~intake,data=merc) )
@

A fitted-line plot \figrefp{fig:HGFLP} is constructed by submitting the \R{lm()} object to \R{fitPlot()}.\index{Regression!Finding best-fit line}

<<HGFLP, fig.cap="Fitted-line plots for the regression of mercury in the blood on mercury intake.">>=
fitPlot(lm1)
@

Predicted values from the linear regression are obtained with \R{predict()}.\index{Predictions!Regression}  The \R{predict()} function requires the saved \R{lm()} object as its first argument.  The second argument is a data.frame constructed with \R{data.frame()} that contains the \textbf{EXACT} name of the explanatory variable as it appeared in \R{lm()} set equal to the value of the explanatory at which the prediction should be made.  For example, the predicted amount of mercury in the blood for an intake of 240 $\mu$g per day is \Sexpr{formatC(predict(lm1,data.frame(intake=240)),format="f",digits=1)}, as obtained below.
<<>>=
predict(lm1,data.frame(intake=240))
@

\warn{The name of the explanatory variable used in \R{predict()}  must be exactly the same as it appears in the original data frame.}

The coefficient of determination is computed by submitting the saved \R{lm()} object to \R{rSquared()}. For example, \Sexpr{formatC(rSquared(lm1,percent=TRUE),format="f",digits=1)}\% of the variability in mercury in the blood is explained by knowing the amount of mercury at intake.

The simple linear regression model appears to fit the data moderately well as the fitted-line plot \figrefp{fig:CarFit} shows only a very slight curvature and only very slight heteroscedasticity.\footnote{In advanced statistics books, objective measures for determining whether there is significant curvature or heteroscedasticity in the data are used.  In this book, we will only be concerned with whether there is strong evidence of curvature or heteroscedasticity.  There does not seem to be either here.}  The sample slope is \Sexpr{formatC(coef(lm2)[2],format="f",digits=4)}, the sample intercept is \Sexpr{formatC(coef(lm2)[1],format="f",digits=1)}, and the coefficient of determination is \Sexpr{formatC(rSquared(lm2),format="f",digits=3)}.

\begin{QAlist}
  \item What is the response variable?
  \begin{QAlist}
    \item The response variable in this analysis is the highway MPG, because that is the variable that we are trying to learn about or explain the variability of.
  \end{QAlist}
  \item What is the explanatory variable?
  \begin{QAlist}
    \item The explanatory variable in this analysis is the weight of the car (by process of elimination).
  \end{QAlist}
  \item In terms of the variables of the problem, what is the equation of the best-fit line?
  \begin{QAlist}
    \item The equation of the best-fit line for this problem is HMPG = \Sexpr{formatC(coef(lm2)[1],format="f",digits=1)} - \Sexpr{formatC(-1*coef(lm2)[2],format="f",digits=4)}Weight.
  \end{QAlist}
  \item Interpret the value of the slope in terms of the variables of the problem.
  \begin{QAlist}
    \item The slope indicates that for every increase of one pound of car weight the highway MPG decreases by \Sexpr{formatC(coef(lm2)[2],format="f",digits=4)}, on average.
  \end{QAlist}
  \item Interpret the value of the intercept in terms of the variables of the problem.
  \begin{QAlist}
    \item The intercept indicates that a car with 0 weight will have a highway MPG value of \Sexpr{formatC(coef(lm2)[1],format="f",digits=1)}, on average.\footnote{This is the correct interpretation of the intercept.  However, it is nonsensical because it is an extrapolation; i.e., no car will weight 0 pounds.}
  \end{QAlist}
  \item What is the predicted highway MPG for a car that weighs 3100 lbs?
  \begin{QAlist}
    \item The predicted highway MPG for a car that weighs 3100 lbs is \Sexpr{formatC(coef(lm2)[1],format="f",digits=5)} - \Sexpr{formatC(-1*coef(lm2)[2],format="f",digits=5)}(3100) = \Sexpr{formatC(predict(lm2,data.frame(Weight=3100)),format="f",digits=1)} MPG.  Alternatively, this value is computed with
<<>>=
predict(lm2,data.frame(Weight=3100))
@
  \end{QAlist}
  \item What is the predicted highway MPG for a car that weighs 5100 lbs?
  \begin{QAlist}
    \item The predicted highway MPG for a car that weighs 5100 lbs should not be computed with the results of this regression, because 5100 lbs is outside the domain of the data \figrefp{fig:CarFit}.
  \end{QAlist}
  \item What is the residual for a car that weights 3500 lbs and has a highway MPG of 24?
  \begin{QAlist}
    \item The predicted highway MPG for a car that weighs 3500 lbs is \Sexpr{formatC(coef(lm2)[1],format="f",digits=5)} - \Sexpr{formatC(-1*coef(lm2)[2],format="f",digits=5)}(3500) = \Sexpr{formatC(predict(lm2,data.frame(Weight=3500)),format="f",digits=1)}.  Thus, the residual for this car is 24 - \Sexpr{formatC(predict(lm2,data.frame(Weight=3500)),format="f",digits=1)} = \Sexpr{formatC(24-predict(lm2,data.frame(Weight=3500)),format="f",digits=1)}.  Alternatively, this is computed in R with
<<>>=
24-predict(lm2,data.frame(Weight=3500))
@
Therefore, it appears that this car gets \Sexpr{formatC(-1*(24-predict(lm2,data.frame(Weight=3500))),format="f",digits=1)} MPG less than an average car with the same weight.
  \end{QAlist}
  \item What proportion of the variability in highway MPG is explained by knowing the weight of the car?
  \begin{QAlist}
    \item The proportion of the variability in highway MPG that is explained by knowing the weight of the car is $r^{2}$=\Sexpr{formatC(rSquared(lm2),format="f",digits=2)}.
  \end{QAlist}
  \item What is the correlation between highway MPG and car weight?
  \begin{QAlist}
    \item The correlation between highway MPG and car weight is $r=$\Sexpr{formatC(-1*sqrt(rSquared(lm2)),format="f",digits=2)}.\footnote{Put a negative sign in front of your result from taking the square root of $r^2$, because the relationship between highway MPG and weight is negative.}
  \end{QAlist}
  \item How much is the highway MPG expected to change if a car is 1000 lbs heavier?
  \begin{QAlist}
    \item If he car was 1000 lbs heavier, you would expect the car's highway MPG to decrease by \Sexpr{formatC(-1000*coef(lm2)[2],format="f",digits=2)} (i.e., 1000 slopes).
  \end{QAlist}

  \item \label{revex:RegFawns} \rhw{} Wildlife ecologist in Texas wanted to determine if the amount of precipitation could explain some of the variability observed in the number of fawns born to each doe \citep{GinnettYoung2000}.  Because Texas has many different climatic regions, the state was broken down into eight precipitation zones, and the mean precipitation for each zone over a period of five years was calculated.  Furthermore, the researchers measured the mean number of fawns born per 100 does for each of these five years.
