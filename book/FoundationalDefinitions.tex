\lettrine{S}{tatistical inference is the process} of forming conclusions about a parameter of a population from statistics computed from individuals in a sample.\index{Inference!Definition}\footnote{Formal methods of inference are discussed beginning with \modref{chap:ProbIntro}.} Thus, understanding statistical inference requires understanding the difference between a population and a sample and a parameter and a statistic. And, to properly describe those items, the individual and variable(s) of interest must be identified. Understanding and identifying these six items is the focus of this module.

The following hypothetical example is used throughout this module. Assume that we are interested in the average length of 1015 fish in Square Lake. To illustrate important concepts in this module, assume that all information for all 1015 fish in this lake is known \figrefp{fig:SquareLakePopn}. In ``real life'' this complete information would not be known.
