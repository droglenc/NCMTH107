I didn't manage my time well, which resulted in me procrastinating actually doing as much studying as I should have. In addition, I had two other exams after this Stats exam, and I had previously gotten terrible grades on exams in those classes, so I spent the majority of my time preparing for those two exams. The week of this exam, I pulled several all nighters, including the night before all three of my exams. (NOT a smart decision). I panicked that I wouldn't do well on my Statistics exam nor my Chemistry exam, so I began a futile attempt to cram as much information in my sleep-deprived brain as possible. Having been running on an average of four hours of sleep (when I actually slept) did not help my meager attempts to study for my exams whatsoever. As soon as the exam was placed in front of me, my foggy mind went blank and it was as though I had forgotten all of the information I'd learned previously. So basically, I could have done pretty much everything better to prepare for this exam. I could have managed my time better and not procrastinated until the exam day looked me in my blood shot eyes. I could have gotten adequate sleep and eaten a decent meal before going to class. (Maybe then I wouldn't have gotten sick). But I didn't do any of that, and that is 100% why I got a 28%. ",I ate an apple before going to class because I hadn't eaten anything in over twelve hours. That is literally all I did that actually helped me. Everything else I did just set me up for failure. ,Please see the novel-like response to the question above. ,"When I got my exam back and finally had the courage to look at how poorly I already knew I did, I was baffled by the questions I got wrong. (If I even attempted them). Questions which should have been fairly easy and straight forward were answered with mere scribbles. My atrocious exam score does not have anything to do with the content (which was exactly what we'd learned in class), or the teaching methods (which are extremely informative and helpful), but it has everything to do with how I personally prepared for the exam.
