The third Quiz (see [dates page](../Dates-Current)) will cover material from Module 13 (*Sampling Distributions*), Module 14 (*Probability*), Module 15 (*Hypothesis Testing*), Module 16 (*Hypothesis Testing Errors*), and Module 17 (*Confidence Regions*). Module 18 (*1-Sample Z-Test*) will not be specifically on the quiz (though its concepts will be because it is largely a summary of previous modules). The quiz is primarily application questions but several short answer essay questions will also be asked. The only R  work that you will need to do is related to using `distrib()` for normal distribution calculations. The portion of the [R cheat sheet](../MTH107-Rcheatsheet.pdf) related to `distrib()` will be provided on the quiz. Any material in the module readings and videos (specifically questions on the preparation guides), exercises, or review exercises may be on the quiz.

* [**21%**] Compute probabilities (with a focus on using normal distributions) ... like these [exercises](../../modules/CE/Probability_CE1.html) and [review exercises (section 2)](../../modules/RE/Probability_RevEx.html).
* [**6%**] Identify statistical (null and alternative) hypotheses from a research hypothesis ... [like this exercise](../../modules/CE/HypTesting_CE.html#identifying-hypotheses).
* [**7%**] Calculate a p-value and make a decision ... [like this](../../modules/CE/HypTesting_CE.html#p-value-calculations-and-decisions-i) and [this exercise](../../modules/CE/HypTesting_CE.html#p-value-calculations-and-decisions-ii).
* [**8%**] Calculate a p-value and make a decision within the context of the problem ... [like this](../../modules/CE/HypTesting_CE.html#body-temperature) and [this exercise](../../modules/CE/HypTesting_CE.html#beetle-size) (*but the sample mean will be given to you*).
* [**4%**] Identify type I and II errors within the context of a problem ... [like this exercise](../../modules/CE/HypTestingErrs_CE.html#identifying-type-i-and-ii-errors).
* [**5%**] Calculate &beta; or power (like we did in class and [demonstrated in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJZpx7Mdde4)).
* [**7%**] Calculate and interpret confidence regions ... [like this exercise](../../modules/CE/ConfRegions_CE1.html#confidence-region-calculations).
* [**8%**] Calculate and interpret confidence regions within the context of the problem ... [like this](../../modules/CE/ConfRegions_CE1.html#body-temperature) and [this exercise](../../modules/CE/ConfRegions_CE1.html#beetle-size) (*but the sample mean will be given to you*).
* [**5%**] Compute the required sample size ... [like this exercise](../../modules/CE/ConfRegions_CE1.html#internet-usage).
* [**6%**] Construct numbers (groups of means) that illustrate accuracy and precision ... [like this exercise](../../modules/CE/SamplingDist_CE3.html#accuracy-and-precision).
* [**21%**] There are four short answer questions from the [Sampling Distributions](../../modules/SamplingDist) [Hypothesis Testing](../../modules/HypTesting), [Hypothesis Testing Errors](../../modules/HypTestingErrs), and [Confidence Regions](../../modules/ConfRegions) modules.

I strongly believe that the best way to prepare for this quiz is by ...

1. Reviewing what you did on the exercises. I would carefully compare your answers to the answer keys that are now available. Also pay close attention to the "notes" that I have placed in yellow boxes in the answer keys.
1. Practice more exercises, either in the "more as time permits" links for some modules or in the review exercises (many of these are old test questions) for all modules. Focus on questions that are similar to the ones linked to in the list above.
1. Study your module preparation guide notes carefully. Augment them by rereading portions of the reading where your notes are poor.
1. Start practicing early so that if you have questions you can get help from me or from [the tutors](../Syllabus-Current.html#tutors) (who have tutor hours on the Monday and the Tuesday before the quiz).

The quiz is closed book, closed notes, etc. You should bring a calculator and you MUST use a pencil. You will need to logon to a Northland computer (no personal computers will be allowed) to use `distrib()` for questions that require calculations on a normal distribution. You should only open RStudio and no scripts should be open (i.e., make sure you close all of your scripts in RStudio prior to coming to the quiz). Computer use will be monitored during the quiz. Quizzes written in red ink will not be accepted and will earn a zero. The quiz will begin promptly at 1000 and must be turned in by 1150. Please take care of your personal needs before the quiz so that you do not need to leave class during the quiz (if, for some reason, you do need to leave the room, make sure to leave your phone and other devices in the room and let me know that you are leaving the room).

Please let me know if you have any questions about this quiz.
