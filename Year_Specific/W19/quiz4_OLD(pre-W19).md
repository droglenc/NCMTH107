The fourth Quiz (see [dates page](../Dates-Current)) will cover material from Module 19 (*1-Sample t-Test*), Module 20 (*2-Sample t-Test*), and Module 21 (*Chi-Square Test*). The exam consists of three 11-Step hypothesis tests that will require no R work, with the exception of using `distrib()` to calculate p-values and critical values for confidence regions. Hints for using `distrib()`, the [11 Steps of a Hypothesis Test](../../modules/11-steps), and formulae for the test statistics for each hypothesis test will be provided for you on the quiz ([see here for example](Quiz4_InfoGiven.pdf)). The following are links to examples for each of the questions.

* 1-Sample t-Test. -- [Here](../../modules/CE/1Samplet_CE1.html#fecal-coliform-counts-i), [Here](../../modules/CE/1Samplet_CE2.html#increased-civility-in-nation-states), and [Here](../../modules/CE/1Samplet_CE2.html#sea-level-rise-rate).
* 2-Sample t-Test. -- [Here](../../modules/CE/2Samplet_CE1.html#compost-type-and-germination-rates), [Here](../../modules/CE/2Samplet_CE2.html#commitment-to-adult-animals), and [Here](../../modules/RE/2Samplet_RevEx.html#popcorn-yield-by-variety).
* Chi-Square Test. -- [Here](../../modules/CE/ChiSquare_CE.html#aids-cases), [Here](../../modules/RE/ChiSquare_RevEx.html#distribution-of-cyprinids-in-asia), and [Here](../../modules/RE/ChiSquare_RevEx.html#working-environment-for-nurses).

I strongly believe that the best way to prepare for this quiz is by ...

1. Reviewing what you did on the exercises. I would carefully compare your answers to the answer keys that are now available. Also pay close attention to the "notes" that I have placed in yellow boxes in the answer keys.
1. Practice more exercises, either in the "more as time permits" links for some modules or in the review exercises (many of these are old test questions) for all modules. Focus on questions that are similar to the ones linked to in the list above.
1. Start practicing early so that if you have questions you can get help from me or from [the tutors](../Syllabus-Current.html#tutors) (who have tutor hours on the Monday and the Tuesday before the quiz).

The quiz is closed book, closed notes, etc. You should bring a calculator and you MUST use a pencil. You will need to logon to a Northland computer (no personal computers will be allowed) to use `distrib()` for questions that require calculations on a normal distribution. You should only open RStudio and no scripts should be open (i.e., make sure you close all of your scripts in RStudio prior to coming to the quiz). Computer use will be monitored during the quiz. Quizzes written in red ink will not be accepted and will earn a zero. The quiz will begin promptly at 800 or 1000 depending on your section and must be turned in within one hour and 50 minutes. Please take care of your personal needs before the quiz so that you do not need to leave class during the quiz (if, for some reason, you do need to leave the room, make sure to leave your phone and other devices in the room and let me know that you are leaving the room).

Please let me know if you have any questions about this quiz.
