    * Rest of class was working on class exercises and HW.  Some students still struggling mightily with the idea of the script and data in the same folder, setting the working directory, and read.csv.  Confusion about read.table and tab-delimited in the text.  Need to change that.
    * Many (50%??) worked on their SIUR and project proposal.
    * Told them that the next quiz will be on "Univariate EDA -- Quantitative" ... will form quiz.
    * Announced due dates for SIUR and project proposal several times.
1. **Fri, 29-Jan**
    * Took quiz (<10 minutes)
    * Worked on Quant UEDA class exercises.
    * Told them that next quiz will be on "Univariate EDA -- Categorical", but we will finish Quant and Cat next time.
    * Several struggled with SD calculation.

1. **Mon, 1-Feb**
    * Worked on Quant and Cat UEDA class exercises.  Some (not many) students started HW.
    * Did example of Quant UEAD in class (CWD example).
    * Next quiz is on Normal Distributions.
1. **Wed, 3-Feb**
    * Worked on Norm Dist class exercises.
    * Next quiz on norm dist again
1. **Fri, 5-Feb**
    * Finished normal distribution materials
    * Next quiz on Bivariate EDA - Categorical
    * Sent out exam description

1. **Mon 8-Feb**
    * Worked on Bivariate EDA -- Categorical
    * Most did well, some were very lost (looked very ill-prepared)
    * No questions about the exam ... had sent out essay prompts that morning.
    * Discussed problems with proposals
    * Next day is a review day.

1. **Mon 15-Feb**
    * Worked on Bivariate EDA -- Quantitative
    * Discussed getting rid of the project.
    * Returned the exams ... talked about distribution of scores.
    * Linear regression module for Wed.
1. **Wed 17-Feb**
    * Linear regression CEs and HWs.
1. **Fri 19-Feb**
    * No Class (AFS)

1. **Mon 22-Feb**
    * Cleaned up linear regression concepts.
    * Worked on probability CEs.
    * Assigned sampling distribution preparation ... quiz next time
    * Assigned linear regression for next time, probability for friday.
1. **Wed 24-Feb**
    * Lectured on the major concept of sampling distributions.  About 40 minutes.  Pretty good questions from the students.
    * "good" students finished first two exercises, other students barefly finished first.  I asked them all to make sure they had finished the first two by the start of next class.
    * Will finish remaining exercises next class period.

1. **Fri 4-Mar**
