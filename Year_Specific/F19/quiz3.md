The third Quiz (see [dates page](../Dates-Current)) will cover material from Module 12 (*Sampling Distributions*), Module 13 (*Probability Introduction*), Module 14 (*Hypothesis Testing*), Module 15 (*Hypothesis Testing Errors*), and Module 16 (*Confidence Regions*). Module 17 (*1-Sample Z-Test*) will not be specifically on the quiz (though its concepts will be because it is largely a summary of previous modules). The only R  work that you will need to do is related to using `distrib()` for normal distribution calculations. The portion of the [R Guide](../MTH107-RGuide.pdf) related to `distrib()` will be provided on the quiz. Any material in the module readings and videos (specifically questions on the preparation guides), exercises, or review exercises may be on the quiz.

* [**5%**] Five multiple choice questions. These are primarily definitions or symbols.
* [**20%**] Compute probabilities (with a focus on using normal distributions) ... like these [exercises](../../modules/CE/Probability_CE1.html) and [review exercises (section 2)](../../modules/RE/Probability_RevEx.html).
* [**6%**] Identify statistical (null and alternative) hypotheses from a research hypothesis ... [like this exercise](../../modules/CE/HypTesting_CE1.html#identifying-hypotheses).
* [**7%**] Calculate a p-value and make a decision ... [like this](../../modules/CE/HypTesting_CE1.html#p-value-calculations-and-decisions-i) and [this exercise](../../modules/CE/HypTesting_CE2.html#p-value-calculations-and-decisions-ii).
* [**8%**] Calculate a p-value and make a decision within the context of a problem ... [like this](../../modules/CE/HypTesting_CE1.html#body-temperature) and [this exercise](../../modules/CE/HypTesting_CE1.html#beetle-size) (*but the sample mean will be given to you*).
* [**4%**] Identify type I and II errors within the context of a problem ... [like this exercise](../../modules/CE/HypTestingErrs_CE.html#identifying-type-i-and-ii-errors).
* [**4%**] Calculate &beta; or power (like we did in class and [demonstrated in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJZpx7Mdde4)).
* [**7%**] Calculate and interpret confidence regions ... [like this exercise](../../modules/CE/ConfRegions_CE2.html#confidence-region-calculations).
* [**8%**] Calculate and interpret confidence regions within the context of a problem ... [like this](../../modules/CE/ConfRegions_CE2.html#body-temperature) and [this exercise](../../modules/CE/ConfRegions_CE2.html#beetle-size) (*but the sample mean will be given to you*).
* [**5%**] Compute the required sample size ... [like this exercise](../../modules/CE/ConfRegions_CE2.html#internet-usage).
* [**6%**] Construct numbers (groups of means) that illustrate accuracy and precision ... [like this exercise](../../modules/CE/SamplingDist_CE3.html#accuracy-and-precision).
* [**20%**] There are four short answer questions from the [Sampling Distributions](../../modules/SamplingDist) [Hypothesis Testing](../../modules/HypTesting), [Hypothesis Testing Errors](../../modules/HypTestingErrs), and [Confidence Regions](../../modules/ConfRegions) modules.

The quiz is closed book, closed notes, etc. **You WILL need a calculator** (you may NOT use the calculator on your phone or the computer) and **you MUST use a pencil** (quizzes written in red ink will not be accepted and will earn a zero). The quiz will begin promptly at 0800 for the first section and 1000 for the second section and must be completed within 1 hour and 50 minutes. Please take care of your personal needs before the quiz so that you do not need to leave the classroom during the quiz (if, for some reason, you do need to leave the classroom, make sure to leave your phone and other devices in the room and let me know that you are leaving the room; failing to do so will earn a zero).

The best way to prepare for this quiz is by ...

1. Reviewing your work on the module exercises. Carefully compare your answers to the answer keys available on each module page, paying close attention to the "notes" in yellow boxes.
1. Practice more exercises, either in the "more as time permits" links or in the review exercises (many of these are old test questions) for all modules. Focus on questions that are similar to those linked to above.
1. Study your module preparation guide notes carefully. Augment them by rereading portions of the reading where your notes are poor.
1. Start practicing early so that if you have questions you can get help from me or from [the tutors](../Syllabus-Current.html#tutors).

Please let me know if you have any questions about this quiz.
